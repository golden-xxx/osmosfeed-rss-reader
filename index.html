                              <span>I (19M) plan on buying my first car before summer. My parents are going to pitch in about 1-2k. Me and my dad have been looking at auctions for a car thats not too old. 
 I’ve been driving for 3 years but it has been my parents car that they never really used. But now that im in college I want my own set of wheels.
 My dad says I should find a cheap car around 4-5k and finance it to also build some credit since I don’t yet have a score.

                              <span>Im in the planning/estimating phase of a new home build. 
 So here&#x27;s the situation. I already own the land and there is a house on the lot. We live in it but it needs everything. Roof, mold mitigation, every wall is plaster, subfloor are warped, electric and plumbing are shot, hvac is not installed right, every window and door is clapped, foundation is crumbling, Ghosts ect.
 I could throw 200k at it and we would still have problems. Zillow estimate puts us at 350k but houses around here sell for like 600k+ and we&#x27;re in a primo spot so tbd on what we will appraise at.
 The house sits on a 5 acer plot and I want to build a new house next to it and demo the old one. 
 I have a background in engineering and I manage contractors for a living so I want to be my own GC. The house will be a barndo. I have quotes for the kit, construction, site work and ill bid out the other trades when we&#x27;re ready for rough in work once all the framing is done.
 Question is should I take out a construction loan? I was looking into FFBKC since they let you be your own GC and lend for the barndo concept 
 Or should I take out a HELOC and borrow what&#x27;s needed. Or cash out refinance and use the money from that.
 I have about 100k cash for this venture and no debt. I make 145k annually.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I got into a dispute with ATT because they of a trade in. I turned in my phone to upgrade to an s25 and they said it would cover the bill of the s25. After six months I was still being billed the full price. After several calls they said they never got it. I called the store and they said they don’t have records dating back six months. I recorded all these conversations. I got in touch with someone from their “office of the president” who played phone tag with me for a week and then claimed the matter was resolved in an email. 
 I got sick of it and went to Verizon. ATT sent me a bill for 800. They charged my credit card which I disputed because I did nott consent to that charge. I logged in to my att portal and it shows I have a negative balance of $765. 
 What is the best course of action here?

                              <span>So I currently hold over $10k in a HYSA. My living expenses are roughly $1k-1.5k a month (renting from friend&#x27;s parent) and I make on average $3.2k a month (Contract work). Got nailed by taxes pretty hard ($6k), and I&#x27;m looking at how to plan moving forward outside of memorizing the tax code for my state lol.
 My original plan was to set up a sinking fund to cover moving out expenses (10%) and put 15% into the Rath. However that plan needs to be put on pause for obvious reasons. Now I could dip into my efund and simply adjust said plan, with the 15% going into rebuilding it and the 10% going into the IRA, but while these taxes are definitely scary, I think I can pay them off with monthly payments and by filing an extension. I had no issues paying them off last year, so I don&#x27;t have a negative reputation with the IRS. That and the last thing I need is to pay off taxes only for an actual emergency to happen.
 What do yall think? Is this a sound approach to dealing with these expenses? Would you deem taxes a suitable emergency? Should I drop everything (including the Rath) to pay these off (Baby Step 2)? Would love your feedback.
 If I don&#x27;t respond immediately, I&#x27;m on the way home. Thanks everyone!

                              <span>I am getting ready to sell my house. My house is paid off. I would love to be able to buy my next house before I sell mine for these reasons:
  
Inventory in my area is very limited. I am concerned that I will be hard pressed to find a suitable place in a reasonable time.
 
I would like to move gradually.
 
 If I take money from a IRA for a down payment on a new home, I have to repay the IRA within 60 days or incur a $50,000. tax hit. I think that’s too risky. 
 I spoke to a lender who recommended the following: I believe the best option for P would be obtaining a new mortgage, using her retirement funds for the down payment, &amp; adding a recast option to her mortgage.
 Ideally, P should try to sell her current home around the same time as she closes on her new home so we can use these sale …</span>

                              <span>I know the topic of including international stocks has come up a few times this week, but I finally made the change. A few years ago I read The Simple Path to Wealth and started following it&#x27;s principles, not perfectly, but as well as I could in my situation with a young family. I have been watching VXUS over the past year due to seeing an interview with J.L. where he mentioned that he would tell his daughter to watch out for international stocks starting to outperform U.S. stocks due to changes in the global economy. When I saw his blog post this month, I decided to include international stocks as well and I intend to be invested in them long term. 
 I saw another post here that recommended moving all stocks to VT for it&#x27;s simplicity and just let it ride. However, isn&#x27;t cost also a major factor? I wanted to keep an eye on costs and implement this in the most cost effective way possible. What I did is take a portion from VTI and move it to VXUS, which will give me a better expense ratio and have very similar performance as just holding VT. VT has an expense ratio of .06%, VXUS is .05%, and VTI is .03%. So, for example, if I have a total of $10,000 invested with approximately $6,000 in VTI and $4,000 (about 60% U.S. and 40% international) I&#x27;m only paying .03% for the bulk of my stock portfolio and .05% for the international component instead of .06% to hold everything in one fund. It&#x27;s easy for me to rebalance to keep about the same ratios as VT as well because I add to the fund throughout the year and can add a little more to VTI or more to VXUS to keep in line with VT. What are some of the arguments against this approach? Is it just for simplicity and not tinkering with your investments?

                              <span>I bought a car almost 2 months ago from a CDJR dealer in MI
 Paid deposit, signed, took truck home. When time came to pay, we hadn’t received any information on the bank yet. We called the dealer and they had us come back in since they worked a better deal out with the same bank- cool whatever better deal
 Now apparently our payment is due tomorrow, but nothing is finalized at the bank STILL.
 Our temp tag expires tomorrow as well. Not too sure what to do or go around this.

                              <span>My 401k is still being handled by my previous employer. I’m wondering how do I transfer the funds to my current employer or possibly on my own? I’m not sure that I want to transfer to my current employer because I read that they do not match at all. I’m not sure what is recommended in this situation but I am asking for guidance.

 Will this be a problem? Do I advise the company? I believe they want a copy of marriage certificate

                              <span>Last summer my father made a poor choice when he needed a new roof - he went through Erie Roofing, financed through Goodleap, and paid probably twice as much as he should have. He passed away unexpectedly a few weeks ago and we don’t know what to do about the loan. He was the only name on the loan, we have no estate because he didn’t have many assets or money. Nearly all of his bank accounts had me listed in trust and the house is in his and my mother’s name (she is still with us.) my mother is on Social Security and it may not be enough for her to live off of and keep the home, although we are going to try, but the loan will make it nearly impossible. I hate the idea of not paying a debt, but is there any option that allows us to have the loan forgiven due to his death?
 Also - the salesman for Erie specifically told my parents that if he were to die the loan would not have to be repaid, I feel like that was a predatory move on his part and not fully accurate.

                              <span>I recently bought an off plan studio apartment in Dubai. specifically Dubailand Residence Complex. There are goijg to be major changes and upgrades to the area by 2030. Metros being built, community filling up, 3 malls, a city dedicated to students right above it, new etihad rail, etc... huge developments. price was 548k aed which is 149k usd give or take. now, the studio is 319 sqft and its projected to get done in q3 2028. Current rent there is 45k aed a year (12250 usd/year). 
 The eay its going with inflation and general uptrend of studio rent prices/the upgrades to the area I mentioned earlier everyone is predicting rent to be 55k aed a year (roughly 15k usd) so the roi seems good. 
 payment plan is 20% upfront and 1500 usd a month until completion which will be 50% of the property then after that ill have 20% more saved up meaning ill have to get mortgage for the other 30% (probably going to end hp being a 3 year mortgage on 4% fee). 
 All that said, im 35 and have a small family. This is my introduction to the real estate investment side of things. Was this a smart decision or a bad one?

I have $58,495 in my 401k where I have a 6% employer match and just increased my contribution from 10% to 15% to get close to maxing it out.

                              <span>I have 4 credit cards. I use them all. One is my main card which I typically put 3-5k on every month and then pay it off in full on time every month.
 The others I use for subscriptions and odd purchases here and there, probably a total of about $600 across those cards.
 My total utilization never passes 10%. I applied for a new card because my main one is pretty barebones and doesnt offer many rewards. I found one that has decent rewards for travel and dining, so I applied.
 Credit score: 798
 Total unused credit: 72k
 Current balance across all cards: $3200
 Gross Annual income (combined with wife): 312k
 I got approved and they extended me a $5.1k credit line. This is far lower than my current card. Im just confused about why it would be so low.
 I spoke with a coworker and he said its probably because credit companies want me to carry a balance and they dont want someone who pays it off in full every month. Is this the case?

 Today I logged in to my account just because, and see there is a refinance loan open on my account dated 2/18. I didnt ask to apply for a loan i didn’t say i wanted a loan I clearly stated I just wanted info and in the call it was stablished I needed to work on my credit and other things before I did anything… is this legal or even normal?? Did this person create a loan application without my consent?? Is this what happens when you call to ask about info? 
 I did not call to apply for a loan AT ALL!!! Let alone to refinance my 2021 3.25% rate. I don’t know what to do!

If the Roth IRA is so great, why wouldn&#x27;t you want to also do a Roth 401(k)? It seems like they adhere to the same taxation rules, so is there something substantially different about Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA accounts that make them fundamentally different animals that I&#x27;m just not aware of? Maybe it&#x27;s simply for diversification? The only real difference I&#x27;ve heard is that Roth IRAs typically allow for more aggressive investment options and the ability to withdraw contributions easier, but that&#x27;s about it.
 My job allows me to contribute to a traditional and/or Roth 401(k) with a match up to 4% - my understanding is if I were to switch to a Roth percentage, their match would still go to a traditional, pre-tax account instead - and I&#x27;m currently maxing it out on the traditional side while maxing a separate Roth IRA. I&#x27;m not uncomfortable with that arrangement, but it still irks me not understanding what makes a Roth 401(k) &quot;bad&quot; but a Roth IRA &quot;good&quot; in the eyes of a lot of people (I know it&#x27;s largely subjective and relative to individuals&#x27; goals, but you know what I mean), when they&#x27;re like... the same thing as far as I can tell.
 Thanks in advance for any information.

                              <span>I&#x27;m moving out of my parents house at 25 into a 1 bed 1 bath apartment. The place is really nice but the rent is just shy of $1600/month. My normal take home monthly is about $4200. I know this is well above the recommended 1/3rd of net to be put towards rent. However, I have absolutely no debt whatsoever. I&#x27;ve spent the last 4 years aggressively paying off all of my student loans while living at home and also own my car. I&#x27;m pretty confident I can make it on $2600 a month and will still be able to save some money. I mostly just want a nice place to live. Has anyone done something like this successfully? Or is this a terrible idea?

                              <span>Im 24, my knowledge on finances are slim and I am terrified for my mom.
 She is in her late 60’s, working overtime just to survive, going through a divorce with my dad and has a new worrying intake of alcohol.
 Shes started on dating apps and lost $6000 by sending it to her “boyfriend” overseas. I didnt know until it happened, uploaded his picture to google and found the guy her scammer was posing as. This was around 6 months ago, that $6000 was basically her whole savings. I put parental controls on her phone which she was okay with and it worked for a while but she decided she wanted to try again.
 She showed me a check her new “boyfriend” sent to her house, for $900,000 in his name, which was obviously fake. She didnt know it was fake but was worried so she showed it to me. I used the same method and found who this scammer was posing as.
 Do you have any tips on protecting her finances?
 *Edit*
 She realizes her mistakes and has been asking me for help. I dont want to take complete control of her finances, I just want to help her not loose large sums of money.

The mother of a student who was killed in the 2023 Nottingham attacks has said she will “fight to the bitter end” to get to the truth of how Valdo Calocane was free to attack, before the beginning of a public inquiry into the incident.
Barnaby Webber and Grace O’Malley-Kumar, 19-year-old students, and 65-year-old caretaker Ian Coates were fatally stabbed by Calocane on 13 June 2023 in a frenzied attack. Early the next day, Calocane drove a van into pedestrians Wayne Birkett, Sharon Miller and Marcin Gawronski, leaving all three with severe and life-changing injuries.

The US Secret Service shot and killed an armed intruder who breached the perimeter of Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump’s Florida residence and private club in Palm Beach, early on Sunday.
Although the US president often spends weekends at the ocean resort, he was at the White House in Washington during this incident, as was first lady Melania Trump.

Graeme Wearden: Trump’s trade war risks undermining his hopes of hefty US interest rate cuts

High-level talks with the US administration over the threat of increased tariffs are under way as the UK government says it wants “the best possible deal” for UK companies.
Business leaders said they expected the UK to “double down” on the existing Economic Prosperity Deal (EPD) – announced by Donald Trump and Keir Starmer in May last year – rather than walk away.

Donald Trump has told Netflix to remove the Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice from its board or “face the consequences”, while the streaming platform is locked in an extraordinary corporate battle to take control of Warner Bros Discovery (WBD).
In comments posted on his Truth Social platform, the US president described Rice – who served as national security adviser to Barack Obama and UN ambassador and White House adviser under Joe Biden – as a “political hack” and accused her of having “no talent or skills”.

Kemi Badenoch has said the Conservatives would scrap the “unfair debt trap” of high interest rates on student loans, piling pressure on Labour ministers to tackle the growing outrage over the high costs.
The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, admitted the system of plan 2 loans had “problems” but suggested the government’s priority would be maintenance grants for poorer students, rather than tackling the high interest rates.

Fewer than one in 10 boys aged 14 to 16 in the UK read daily, according to research, which found reading for pleasure was being crowded out of teenage lives by schoolwork, screens and sports.
While reading declines for both boys and girls in early adolescence, there are “signs of recovery” among girls in later teenage years, but boys’ engagement remains persistently low, according to the National Literacy Trust (NLT).

A Guardian analysis of government records has found that the vast majority – 77% – of people who entered deportation proceedings for the first time in 2025 had no criminal conviction, exposing a stark gap between the Trump administration’s rhetoric and reality.
Within days of Donald Trump’s inauguration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) trotted out a phrase that his surrogates would come to use over and over again: “the worst of the worst.”
Fewer than half of the people in the data (40%) had any criminal charge against them, and only 23% had a conviction.
Of those who did have a criminal conviction, nearly half were for non-violent traffic and immigration offenses.
Traffic offenses alone made up nearly 30% of the convictions, the largest category by far.
Some 9% of criminal convictions were for assault, while only 1% were for sexual assault and just 0.5% were for homicide.

Scotland Yard is using AI tools supplied by the US tech company Palantir to monitor staff behaviour in an attempt to root out failing officers, the Guardian has learned.
The Metropolitan police has previously declined to confirm or deny whether it used technology supplied by the company, which also works for the Israeli military and Donald Trump’s ICE operation. It has now confirmed that it is using Palantir’s AI to analyse internal data about sickness levels, absences from duty and overtime patterns in an effort to identify potential shortcomings in professional standards.

The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, has said he will summon Charles Kushner, the US ambassador to France, over comments related to the killing of the French far-right activist Quentin Deranque.

Swarmer, which bills itself as a battle-tested Ukrainian startup specializing in autonomous drone software, filed for an initial public offering and has recruited Prince to help sell the company as non-executive chair.

Parts of the Maga right may be souring on Israel – but a hardline form of Christian Zionism seems to remain unofficial Trump administration policy, if a heated debate between Tucker Carlson and Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, is any indication.

                              <span>Hi all,
 24M fresh grad here. Entered corporate last year and currently earning a take home of ~ RM4.2k/month or RM50k/year. I am very lucky that I live with my parents and no need to pay for rent. Mom is a stay at home housewife so she usually cooks me lunch for me to bawak bekal to office. Same goes for dinner, as she cooks for the whole family.
 I am also naturally frugal and dont spend much on clothes or outing. No financial commitment as well. No girlfriend, car, or any student loan. I also commute to work by public transport everyday. So technically I only spend about RM200 out of my pocket every month for Netflix, PS+, late night kopitiam etc. This means I save RM4k/month on the regular after deducting all my expenses.
 My dad takes home about RM10k per month, with a fully paid hous…</span>

                              <span>I just found out that Robert Kiyosaki is coming to Malaysia on Feb 27 and I’m not sure if I should attend.
 I used to be into personal finance and investing (crypto and stocks), but I paused everything for 3 years while I was in Australia. I didn’t follow financial news much during that time. Now I’m back working and trying to reconnect, but I feel rusty.
 The ticket is about USD150. For those who’ve attended his talks before, is it worth it? Is it practical or mostly motivation? And does he usually repeat the same ideas from his books, or does he share new insights?
 Thanks 🙏

                              <span>I need help, with budgeting. Gonna get a real job soon, in puchong, will rent in subang (20+ min travel, by bike). Is my budget good, or is there possible improvements.
 Net salary (after deduction + parents) - 2000, excluding meal allowance(400)
 Rent - 600 (include utils)
 Food - 800 (including groceries, twice a month)
 Fuel + maintenance - 90
 Saving + Investment - 300
 Internet - 50 
 Total - 1840
 I might need to increase the internet, since the room im renting has no wifi. I have no costly hobbies, thats why i decided to topup on food. Really choosy with the room, as i rather have a literal empty room if its squeaky clean. Rarely cook, mostly eat outside, this budget mostly derived from my current spending as an intern.

                              <span>Hi guys. I just wanna ask about how should i do to improve my current financial worries (sorry, i only can tag 1, i wish i can tag more flairs). Btw, i&#x27;m not good in english, so please bare with me.
 I just turned to 40yo this year. Currently i do part time grab + part time stock trader with income around 3k-5k per month. Below is my current assets, liabilities and monthly spending budget
 Assets:
 ASB - 300k
 EPF - 200k
 Saving - 10k
 Liability:
 House loan - 270k
 Spending:
 Monthly loan payment - 1.5k
 Water and eletric - 300
 Family internet - 300 (include home and internet mobile data)
 Transport - 500
 Groceries - 600
 Balance - 50% to my wife, 50% saving.
 Tbh, i just tired on doing this part time jobs. So i was thinking of looking for jobs. I have degree in accounting. I used to work as an executive of one of sme company till i got vss during covid end of 2019. So for these years, i worked multiple jobs like grab for time being at that time. On year 2021, i drawn into trading stock and investment and become stock trader till today. Unfortunately, i just felt tired at some point, especially when you didn&#x27;t get to meet your monthly end commitments.
 So i was thinking of looking for jobs, but from what i read and watch, employment is really bad, even for newly fresh graduate. And even i don&#x27;t think i will get iv after applying jobs based on my age and status. 
 My apology if my post here is a bit &quot;mess up&quot;, i dunno the correct word. Anyway, please help me.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I’m from Sarawak, and I would like to respectfully seek guidance regarding a family heirloom . It is an old Iban Kain Kumbu textile that has been passed down through approximately 4–5 generations in my family.... l am not sure but would like to ask an expert about this!!
 Family lineage timeline:
 • My late great-great grandmother • Passed down to my late great grandmother • Then to my grandmother • Then to my mother • Now in my possession 
 According to my mother’s oral history, this textile was worn by an ancestor named Niang Inik Kantan. The longhouse origin is unfortunately unknown as most elders in our family have passed away sadly no information was to further explaining more about this Kain Kumbu
 The piece appears:
 • Handwoven • Naturally dyed (earth tones, deep browns, muted red/blue) • Smaller in size compared to modern 1970s–1990s Kain Kumbu • In good structural condition • Has a natural woody scent consistent with aged textile storage 
 I am genuinely seeking:
 1. Advice on authentication. 2. How to verify age (pre-1900? 1800s?). 3. Whether museum textile experts in Sarawak or Malaysia would be appropriate to consult. 4. General historical context of early Kain Kumbu weaving. 
 I deeply respect its cultural and spiritual value, and I want to approach this carefully and correctly. Because this is from our family heirloom and been on generations...
 Any guidance from historians, textile experts, collectors, or museum professionals would be sincerely appreciated.
 Thank you.
 Comparison size to the modern one on second photo..

                              <span>So recently got an Insta and for Monoloop in Amcorp Mall, PJ. Promoted itself as having a large collection of old cameras, vinyl and other collectibles.
 Went there and yup, they weren&#x27;t kidding about the huge racks and piles of camera gear strewn all around. 
 Ngl, it was quite fun sorting around the racks and seeing what gems I can pick out. 
 I wonder, are ther any other places like this around KL? Thrift stores, garage sales, etc?

                              <span>FYI - Just based on the data from PickleWatch on the apple app store!😅
 Been tracking pickleball games worldwide and the international growth has been wild. From June 2025 to Feb 2026, Malaysia surged from 4th all the way to #1 outside the US.
 Over 10,000 games tracked across 60+ countries. Happy to answer any questions about the data!
 For those curious — here&#x27;s the same chart with the US included:

                              <span>im in this situation where my dad would beat me up w no remorse and my mother would just stand there and let him do it. today was my last straw. he strangled me and tried to kill me. when i wanted to leave that abusive home but he threaten to file a missing police report.
 im 22F and i left that house and trying to find a place currently w the savings i have currently.
 i have a few questions if anyone can give me advice
  
legally can my parents and the police do anything to drag me back? going back to abusive parents is the last thing i want to do. id rather die on my own term then their hands
 i am currently doing acca but im planning to drop out because my mental health cant take this anymore. i have a degree in accounting in one of the top unis in the world but little to no job exprince. since im going to be finding a place and living on my own, i will need a job (currently living in airbnbs and crashing at friends houses) is me dropping out of acca to prioritise getting a job a good decision rn? (keep in mind if i dont do this, ill be force to live w abusive parents)
 is it possible for me to get a fresh grad accounting job in less than a month with just my degree and that supports me (rental and food, i do not own a car or any have any loans)
 lastly, as of rn idk what to do, should i go police and report that my dad tried to kill me by strangling me? im scared if i do, theyll just send me back to my parents. do i stay quiet and try to find a fresh grad job asap and cut contact w them completely?
  
any advice would be appreciated

                              <span>Don&#x27;t get an expensive master&#x27;s degree unless you truly need it for career advancement (i.e., you have a very concrete and realistic plan of how you will pay for it). 
 I am a teacher at a private boarding school in Massachusetts. A lot of my colleagues found themselves in the workforce for a few years, usually as teachers, then decided that their life felt stagnant and got a master&#x27;s degree from places like Columbia or whatever. They figured it was a logical next move as a typical &quot;striver&quot; who wants to achieve the next milestone in life, assuming it would lead to new opportunities. Underrated fact: even at places like Harvard, many of these master&#x27;s degrees are not particularly selective and will enroll almost any baseline smart/competent person - they&#x27;re a cash cow for the university primarily used to fund their PhD programs! 
 Anyways, these people end up in serious debt and forego earnings while getting the degrees, sometimes in excess of $100,000. And what did they do with their degree? They went back to teaching - basically the exact same job they already had with the same earning potential. 
 I&#x27;m curious if this is a pattern in other lines of work - do any of your coworkers also randomly get masters degree at enormous expense that they don&#x27;t put to good use? In my opinion you should only go to graduate school for a profession that truly requires the credential (JD, MD, etc), or if you get it funded (via a PhD program or through your employer).

I wasn&#x27;t up at that time and the location isn&#x27;t open yet, and I plan to call them... since I&#x27;m not shipping anything and I don&#x27;t have my card on file with FedEx, how concerned should I be?

                              <span>My mother was given US savings bonds from the woman she cared for as a gift, a substantial amount. These were purchased decades ago, back in the 60s-80s. My mom never did anything with them, and the lady ended up passing away about 10 years ago. We recently found them when she was going through some attic stuff. 
 Her husband passed away a decade before she did, and she had no children. Should we just throw them away?
 EDIT: These bonds are not in my mom&#x27;s name, the lady who passed away just handed them to my mom over the years as gifts.

                              <span>Hi everyone, 26M looking for some advice on whether my current investment approach makes sense for my age and goals.
 I have about RM2.8k per month to invest, and this is my current monthly allocation:
  
ASB: RM1,000/month
 ETFs: RM800/month (I’ve only recently started getting into ETFs)
 Crypto: RM1,000/month (currently higher to take advantage of the bear market)
  
Current portfolio breakdown:
  
ASB: RM120k
 Crypto: RM15k (Only BTC &amp; ETH)
 Liquid: RM15k
  
My goal is long-term wealth growth, and I’m comfortable with some level of risk since I’m still young.
 I’d really appreciate opinions on:
  
Whether this overall strategy looks reasonable for a 26 year old
 If I should be more conservative or more aggressive
 Thoughts on the split between ASB, ETFs, and crypto, especially as I’m just starting with ETFs. Should I put more into ETF to build it up ASAP and slow down on ASB?
  
Thanks in advance for any feedback!

                              <span>There&#x27;s quite a lot of apps to do investment in. So I wonder which ones are the best to put your money in. I&#x27;ve aldy have money in asnb and trying to learn moomoo. And I just tried the Ryt Bank. There&#x27;s also bursa gold. So it&#x27;s quite a lot to managed. So I just want to limit to a few. I know its good to expand but sometimes it&#x27;s hard to keep track. How do you keep track of all your investments.

 Moving in means a good chunk of my income goes to my mortgage. If I rent it out and rent elsewhere to live then I get more cashflow. But also trying to get a sense of how much Malaysians spend on their mortgage/rent. 
 Please do not provide answers like “you should spend 25%-30%” on your mortgage. I am highly aware of this.

Osaka has received a hefty gift of gold bars worth 560m yen (£2.7m) from an anonymous donor and a request for its specific use: to fix the Japanese city’s dilapidated water pipes.
The gold bars, weighing a total of 21kg (46lb), were given to the Osaka City Waterworks Bureau in November by the donor who wants to help improve ageing water pipes, the mayor, Hideyuki Yokoyama, told reporters on Thursday.

Bolivia’s long-serving socialist former leader, Evo Morales, reappeared on Thursday in his political stronghold of the tropics after almost seven weeks of unexplained absence, endorsing candidates for upcoming regional elections and quieting rumours he had fled the country in the wake of the US seizure of his ally, Venezuela’s ex-president Nicolás Maduro.
The weeks of hand-wringing over Morales’ fate showed how little the Andean country knows about what’s happening in the remote Chapare region, where the former president has spent the past year evading an arrest warrant on human trafficking charges, and how vulnerable it is to fears about US president Donald Trump’s potential future foreign escapades.

The siege and capture of the Sudanese city of El Fasher by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces group last October bore “the hallmarks of genocide”, a UN-mandated fact-finding mission has said.
In a report detailing the harrowing 18-month occupation of the capital of North Darfur, investigators concluded that the RSF and allied militias deliberately inflicted conditions calculated to bring about the physical destruction of the Zaghawa and Fur ethnic communities.

                              <span>Hi guys, need some advice.. parents are getting to that age when they want to settle their inheritance issue. Our thought is, rather than splitting up assets and giving this sibling this or that to individually manage, it would be better financially to put everything in a trust or a company and have all sibling manage/share it equally. The basic thinking is that we can do more when we pool our assets all together. From what I’ve read online there are some pros to doing this, protection of assets in case of bankruptcy, and more structured financial planning for future generations..
 I’ve briefly talked to some people (relatives who are in a related field) and so far the initial reaction I get is not to do it because it usually causes rifts in the family but when I dig deeper the cause of that is usually because nobody discusses or agrees to exit terms beforehand.
 So, leaving out family dynamics, just wanted some input on whether it financially makes sense and if so what are technical ways to do this? Very interested to hear from people who’ve actually done something like this. TIA!

                              <span>I have a 40 year old 2-storey terrace house I had inherited. It used to be rented out but had been abandoned for about 20 years.
 The property is in a mature township and can fetch about RM400,000 for similar (non-abandoned) units. 
 The house is paid off already, so other than taxes, it doesn’t require any maintenance (other than reimbursing my neighbour for fixes affecting them or cutting the grass) . I’ve received offers around RM250,000 pre-COVID but held on to it hoping for something nearer to RM300,000. I presume the new buyer will spend minimum 100k to refurbish the unit. 
 Just want to rule out keeping the property. I have other homes and have a mortgage on my current own stay. Rental isn’t an option as I don’t want to spend any money fixing the house.
 Questions:
  
How is RPGT calculated? 
  
- S&amp;P was done 40 years 
 - Deceased 20 years ago
 - My name on grant by land office only done last year
  
How much agent fees should I expect? 2% of transacted price? 
 
I have bought subsale before and presume legal expenses bourne by purchaser. Is this correct? Do I incur any legal fees as a seller?
 
Any other tips?

Peru’s congress has elected José María Balcázar, an octogenarian leftist lawmaker who has defended child marriage, as the country’s interim president ahead of general elections in April.
Balcázar is Peru’s ninth president since 2016. The surprise election, in which Balcázar beat the favourite, María del Carmen Alva, a conservative, came after lawmakers voted to remove José Jerí as president on Tuesday after just four months in office, due to a scandal over secretive meetings with Chinese businessmen.

More than 1,000 Kenyans have been lured to fight for Russia in its war with Ukraine, according to an intelligence report to the Kenyan parliament that highlights the scale of a Russian operation taking African men to the frontline.
The majority leader of Kenya’s national assembly, Kimani Ichung’wah, said “rogue recruitment agencies and individuals in Kenya” were continuing to send Kenyan nationals to fight in the conflict, as he read MPs the summary of an investigation by Kenya’s National Intelligence Service.

The former chancellor George Osborne has said countries that do not embrace the kind of powerful AI systems made by his new employer, OpenAI, risk “Fomo” and could be left weaker and poorer.
Osborne, who is two months into a job as head of the $500bn San Francisco AI company’s “for countries” programme, told leaders gathered for the AI Impact summit in Delhi: “Don’t be left behind.” He said that without AI rollouts they could end up with a workforce “less willing to stay put” because they might want to seek AI-enabled fortunes elsewhere.

                              <span>Hi all. Just looking to start investing in ETFs for 2026. Targeting RM2.5k per month using IBKR (together with my wife as joint holder)
 Came across this allocation in the ETF Reddit, supposedly from US citizen perspective.
 VTI 50%
 VXUS 30%
 AVUV 10%
 AVDV AVES 5% each
 May I seek some advice as to how the allocation would be different for Malaysians? Thanks in advance

                              <span>Happy CNY / holidays guys!
 29M data analyst here. I’ve been in retail for about 4 years (2 companies). With retail volatility lately, company performance has been quite affected. I recently received a contract offer from a major insurance company in KL. +23% from my current permanent role, with 2 days WFH.
 The downside as you know is that it’s a contract role, so there’s always the uncertainty of renewal/absorption. That said, since it’s a big player in the industry, I’m quite tempted to give it a try.
 Wondering what people think about insurance industry as a whole? I&#x27;ve heard some say with premium prices going up, people might stop paying insurance. 
 The industry is totally new to me so any thoughts is appreciated.

                              <span>Currently I&#x27;m working in medical sales. These are my stats:
  
Base: RM5,900 /month
 (Fixed) Travel Allowance: RM1,000 /month
 (Fixed) Misc Allowance: RM400 /month
  
In your experience, do new employers usually consider your base salary or overall total salary when offering a salary package? Ie. Will they base an offer based on RM5,900 or my total salary RM7,300. As I might pivot to a non-sales role, so the transport allowance given might not be as high. Thanks for any input!

                              <span>Currently working in a tech role. My options are as follows below:
 Company A (current company)
  
RM8.5K / month (including allowance)
 4 days WFH, 1 day WFO
 1-3 months bonus
 3-4 % annual increment
 21 days AL
  
Company B (new company)
  
RM11.5K / month (matched by asking salary)
 4 days WFO, 1 day WFH
 1 month bonus (on average)
 ? % annual increment (expecting it to be 2-3%)
 14 days AL
  
I truly value work life balance so my current role is perfect plus the culture and work is fulfilling. I also have a side business that generates roughly RM2-3K / month which may be impacted if I work almost fully in office.
 That said, I acknowledge that company B offers growth in terms of salary progression. What are your thoughts?
 Additional Note:
  
The side business is not very scalable.
 Company B&#x27;s culture seems like a cinaman company, small startup with all guys who tend to communicate in Mandarin (noticed this while waiting for interview), I don&#x27;t speak Mandarin... Plus you&#x27;re expected to stay until 7PM but can come in around 10AM+
 Highly unlikely to get a counteroffer by A as I&#x27;ve already been promoted

                              <span>Long story short, I will be reimbursed for some insurance claim via a physical cheque which will be sent to a relative’s place in the US. The payee name on the check is my name, I am currently living in Malaysia. What’s the easiest and most efficient way for me to cash out this cheque? 
 I understand that wise’s US bank account cannot receive cheque deposits. We are currently considering for me to endorse the cheque to allow 3rd party deposit&gt;relative deposits and receives the cash &gt;transfers to me
 Anyone dealt with the similar experience before ? 
 Thanks

 What about locations with the inverse - used to be thriving with an abundant population / demand which has died out and why?

US military officials have said American forces launched assaults on three alleged drug-smuggling boats, killing 11 in one of the deadliest days of the Trump administration’s months-long campaign against alleged traffickers.
The military action on Monday brought the number of fatalities caused by US strikes to 145 since September, when Donald Trump called on American armed forces to attack people deemed “narco-terrorists” on small vessels. There have been 42 known strikes in notorious drug-trafficking routes such as the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, according to the Associated Press reported.

                              <span>I (M27) recently received a couple of assets from my father. One is a plot of land around 1.5 acres, valued at RM300k. Another one is a brand new single storey terrace house on a corner lot. Both are Malay reserve land.
 The thing is that these assets are in Perak while I live in East Malaysia. I don’t know what to do with the house aside from renting them. As for the land, it is already encroached by my relatives whom I barely know. Any advice?
 Edit: East Malaysia 😅, Somewhere rural in Sabah

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am quite financial illiterate (or investment illiterate), and i want to start with investing. Currently i already have quite some money in asb, and like to start in either
  
Gold
 
Stocks (s&amp;p 500 etc)
 
Crypto
 
 Previously i have dipped my legs in trading crypto, and when btc and eth boom last year, i sold everything (due to in need of money) and get quite a profit. But looking at crypto dip so bad rn, makes me a bit scared. Im not looking to put a lot in one of these three, probably around rm200-rm500 monthly.
 Any advice from the professionals?

Bangladesh’s new prime minister has been sworn in, sealing a dramatic comeback for the Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP) and formally closing the turbulent chapter that toppled Sheikh Hasina in 2024.

When Boniface Mwangi, the prominent Kenyan pro-democracy activist who plans to run for president in 2027, had his phones returned to him by Kenyan authorities after his controversial arrest last July, he immediately noticed a problem: one of the phones was no longer password protected and could be opened without one.
It was Mwangi’s personal phone, which he used to communicate with friends and mentors, and contained photos of private family moments with his wife and children. Knowing that its contents could be in the hands of the Kenyan government made Mwangi – who has described harassment and even torture – feel unsafe and “exposed”, he told the Guardian.

                              <span>The next crash is from crypto Bitcoin. Reason is 
 You cannot buy anything with it. Many just pay and hard to get money out. 
 It is based on a small number of believers on imaginary value. 
 The derivatives is also a form of imaginary value.
 The crash is when the major holder off load . Left the bag carriers and their false hope . The reality come when margin calls . So much it actually sucks in the financial institutions.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m going to be getting my first salary in a couple of days, and I&#x27;m super excited! My job only lasted 3 weeks since they&#x27;re planning on doing renovation during Ramadan, and I&#x27;m not planning to continue as I&#x27;m going to be busy after getting my spm results, most likely. But that&#x27;s besides the point. 
 I&#x27;d like to know how to spend my first salary? I&#x27;m planning to save up 80% (since I don&#x27;t really have any necessities to spend on now anyway), but I&#x27;ve also thought of investing– buying gold, or investing on amanah saham. I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s best to start as early as I can, but I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;d love to know what you guys think! :)

                              <span>NOTE: We have to step away for a bit but we’ll try to come back and answer more. Thanks again for your questions.
 As we watch the surveillance dystopia unfold across Trump&#x27;s America, we&#x27;ve spent over a year reporting on the technologies used by ICE, DHS, and other local law enforcement to actively surveil, target and detain citizens and immigrants alike.
 Recently, we uncovered the tool Palantir is making for ICE to find neighborhoods to raid, how local police unmasked millions of surveillance targets because of Flock redaction error and how DHS is lying about killing people in Minneapolis.
 Ask us anything on February 4 at 12 pm ET about the state of surveillance in America. Get your questions in now.
