Anthony Albanese says former opposition leader, Sussan Ley was “undermined” by conservative colleagues, Angus Taylor and Andrew Hastie, during her 276-day tenure in the seat.
Speaking to Hit 104.9, which covers Ley’s southern NSW electorate of Farrer, the prime minister criticised the Coalition’s recent internal turmoil while praising his own side of politics. Albanese said:
From day one, she was undermined by Angus Taylor and Andrew Hastie and a range of them who weren’t really working to try to get her success in the party. …
It’s, I think, unfortunate that politics can be a pretty rough game, and that [Ley] was elected by the Liberal party caucus, fair and square, she was the leader, but never even got to give a budget reply. I don’t know if that’s happened before. I’m not sure, but certainly she didn’t even get one year in the office, which is pretty rough.
We want to ensure that people who leave our country and go to terrorist hotspots, people who go there to support terrorist organisations or to support Islamic State or organisations or other terror listed organisations, and then who actually commit crimes over there … they can’t come back to Australia.
I’ve got a newsflash for the government. They are the government. They can change the law. If the law is not strong enough to keep Australians safe and to keep people out who actually hate Australian values and hate the Australian way of life, and who have left our country to fight for an alternate way of life, then we should change those laws.

Forensic evidence linked to Sydney grandfather Chris Baghsarian has been found in a burnt-out car, with police searching bushland for any further clues 11 days after he was kidnapped in a suspected case of mistaken identity.
Acting Det Supt Andrew Marks on Monday urged the public to share any footage they may have of the grey Toyota Corolla, which was found burnt out in Westmead last Tuesday.

Violence erupts after Mexican security forces kill drug cartel boss ‘El Mencho’ 

The drug lord “El Mencho”, who was killed on Sunday by Mexican special forces, was the co-founder and leader of a gang that in recent years had become the country’s most powerful criminal organisation: the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG).
While less internationally famous than the Sinaloa cartel of the now imprisoned Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, the CJNG is a household name in Mexico, where it is known for its displays of ultraviolence and its big, military-style arsenal.

New York mayor Zohran Mamdani has ordered a citywide travel ban for all but emergency travel, as the north-eastern United States was preparing for an intense winter storm that is forecast to reach blizzard strength and bring major disruption.
Residents along the east coast scrambled to prepare for the late-winter storm that spurred weather warnings from Maryland to Massachusetts, affecting more than 35 million people. More than a foot of snow was expected, with wind gusts of up to 70mph and warnings of potential coastal flooding from Cape Cod to Delaware.

The pre-trial hearing for former Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte for his alleged role in a deadly “drug war” is set to begin at the international criminal court on Monday, despite his refusal to attend the proceedings.
Duterte, 80, who was arrested in Manila and flown to The Hague last year, is accused of crimes against humanity over an anti-drugs crackdown in which thousands of people were killed.

The drug lord, whose real name is Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, was killed on Sunday in the western state of Jalisco along with at least six alleged accomplices, the ministry said in a statement.

The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, representing the government, did not rule out such an inquiry but said it was premature because of the police investigation.

Reform UK would create an ICE-style agency dedicated to deporting hundreds of thousands of people, as well as terminating the status of those with indefinite leave to remain (ILR), the party will say.
It would also ban the conversion of churches into mosques and fund a radical expansion of stop and search, the party’s new home affairs spokesperson, Zia Yusuf, will also say in a speech on Monday. The deradicalisation programme Prevent would also have its mandate redrawn to focus on Islamist extremism.

How the ceremony unfolded – the action as it happened

One Battle After Another, Paul Thomas Anderson’s counterculture comedy about a washed-up revolutionary trying to protect his daughter from a ruthless military officer, has dominated the Baftas, taking home six awards including best film, best director, best cinematography, best editing, best supporting actor and best adapted screenplay.
The film, inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s Vineland, was nominated for 14 awards going into Sunday’s ceremony, the most of any contender – including nods for stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn, Benicio del Toro, Chase Infiniti and Teyana Taylor.

Iran and the US are expected to meet for a further round of talks in Geneva this week in a sign that Donald Trump’s team believes Tehran is making serious proposals to dilute its stockpile of highly enriched uranium and show it is not seeking a nuclear weapon.

Top US trade negotiator Jamieson Greer insisted on Sunday that the Trump administration was set to persist with its tariffs policy, two days after the supreme court declared many of Donald Trump’s tariffs illegal.

“TSA PreCheck remains operational with no change for the traveling public,” the Transportation Security Administration said in a social media post. “As staffing constraints arise, TSA will evaluate on a case by case basis and adjust operations accordingly.”

Norway has once again topped the Winter Olympics medal table, surpassing countries with far larger populations.
The Scandinavian country won more gold medals (18) and more total medals (41) than the US, who came second in both categories (12 golds and 33 total medals). Norway’s 18 golds were the most by a country in Winter Olympics history, while their cross-country skiing hero Johannes Høsflot Klæbo accounted for six golds on his own, more than the all but seven other countries at this year’s Games.

                              <span>Hey guys. I have a background in maths and finance, and I&#x27;ve been working on a set of trading strategies for FX and stocks, currently looking to paper trade before deploying fully through an algorithm. Whats a good platform to use? For stocks I currently have moomoo, but idk how it would work with my automation. Also how would capital gains tax work if im regularly buying and selling a stock?
 As far as FX goes, is there a good platform that is safe? I&#x27;m finding it hard to get good advice on it because most people i know who trade Forex are those Forex bros using dodgy unregulated platforms like Justmarket that offer up to 3000x leverage which i think is kinda predatory. I have worked in asset management before and done some investing but pretty clueless as far as actual active day trading goes. Whats a good pip spread for currency pairs like USD/EUR? which platforms offer them, and as far as leverage goes whats a healthy and safe range I could play with or do you think it would be better to stay clear of that?
 Let me know what you think.

                              <span>Hey guys. Long story short, depleted all my savings and only recently started to get back on track. So far last year I managed to save approximately RM20k. I put 2k aside every month into ASB. EPF is approximately 2k a month (employee + employer). I&#x27;m thinking of either putting RM500 aside for ETFs or taking a small chunk of my monthly ASB savings and putting into ETF. It should look something like this: RM1.5k ASB &amp; RM1k ETF
 Is that a smart move? Please help a bro out as I&#x27;m financially illiterate. What other investment options are there?

                              <span>Looking to start a business in Malaysia and live there most likely indefinitely. I am a revert looking to get out of the US. I do not currently have a business but am experienced in IT. I currently consult and would like to create a business in Malay provided email migration support, collaboration, helpdesk support etc. I would probably hire two natives to assist with help desk support if I can land a contract with local businesses.
 Wondering what I need to get started and how hard is it to get accepted? Will they accept a IT / MSP Business? I definitely have the skills and know how to do it and the capital investment they want isn&#x27;t a problem alhamdulilah.

                              <span>拍拖本来是甜甜的事情，但有时候，现实问题一来，心真的会很累。 近日，大马一名女子在「XUAN」发文表示，自己在两性关系中遇到了很大的困扰，不知道该不该继续坚持下去。 她说，男友不支持 AA 制，认为情侣之间不必算得太清楚。但她坚持 AA，是因为不想以后谈婚论嫁时，为钱财问题产生更多矛盾。她说，如果用「这次你请，下次我请」的方式，她常常会忘记上一次是谁付钱，心里反而更有压力。 更让她难受的是，只要男友请客，她就会觉得亏欠对方。她有时晚餐只想简单吃个面包，但男友却坚持要她点饭，还说吃不完他可以帮忙吃。如果她想喝 100Plus，男友也会阻止，说不如去商场买，更便宜，叫她改喝别的水。她觉得，连吃什么、喝什么，都要被管。 除了金钱观不同，男友的性格也让她很为难。男友常常和家人发生争执，就算她在场，对方也会直接开骂，完全不顾她的感受。她尝试过劝说，有话可以好好讲，不一定要用骂的方式，但男友始终觉得自己没有错，也听不进她的意见。 她也提到，男友很喜欢为自己的错误找借口。她生日那天，自己订了一家喜欢的餐厅，晚上 8 点用餐。因为两人住在不同地方，她提议各自前往餐厅，但男友坚持要先到她家载她。她提醒男友要早点出门，至少预留一小时，因为晚餐时间会塞车。没想到，男友还是在 7 点 30 分才出门，结果迟到，餐厅位置也没了。 她非常生气。男友虽然道歉，却解释说「没想到会塞车」。她无奈地说，自己已经提醒过，为什么还是拖到最后才出门？男友却表示，平时没有遇到塞车。最后，她还是选择原谅。 她坦言，每次吵架，男友都会主动说对不起，但她感觉对方并没有真正理解问题。无论她如何耐心解释，对方始终觉得自己是对的。 在报备行踪方面，两人也有分歧。男友认为没有必要报备，因为她也没有要求自己报备。但她表示，男友每天都会和异性聊天，甚至聊完后删除聊天记录，这让她没有安全感。她只是希望对方简单报备一下，却被男友反驳：「当初就是因为你不需要我报备，我才选择和你在一起。」 女子无奈表示，这段感情让她越来越累。她不知道，是自己太计较，还是两人真的不合适。她把经历分享出来，只希望听听大家的意见，也想弄清楚，这样的关系是否值得继续。 ▼ 继续在一起会很痛苦的，分吧！ 感情不是谁对谁错，而是能不能互相体谅。如果一直委屈自己，这段感情还能走多远呢？

                              <span>新年本是团圆与祝福的时刻，但一句无心的话，却让温馨瞬间变了味。 根据「ILifePost 爱生活 」报道，2026 年农历新年，本来应该是开心团圆的日子，却发生了一件让人心寒的事。 因为一些原因，大马一名网友一家人今年还是通过 Zoom 在线上拜年。大家在视频里互相祝福，说说笑笑，气氛还算不错。 这名网友的母亲也通过电子钱包，给几位 00 后的表弟表妹各转了 RM50，当作新年红包。虽然金额不大，但那是一份心意，也是长辈的祝福。 没想到，在准备结束通话时，对方忘了关麦克风，说出几句让人难过的话。 「哇，姑姑好意思只给 RM50，还有人只给 RM10，根本买不到什么，Kiasu 又 Kiamsiap 啦他们！」 这几句话，让这名网友当场愣住，也非常生气。 他随后在 Facebook 发文表示：「现在的小孩子到底怎么了？红包是祝福，不是责任，更不是理所当然。长辈愿意给，是一份心意，不是应该给，更不是一定要给很多。」 他说，现在经济不容易，赚钱比以前更辛苦。很多大人也有自己的压力，但还是愿意包红包，希望他们开心、平安。没想到却被嫌少，甚至被说「吝啬」。 更让人无奈的是，不只是他一个人遇到这种事。他身边也有朋友分享类似经历。有的孩子嫌 RM100 太少，有的会当场比较谁给得多，甚至有人把红包金额当成炫耀的话题。 他无奈地问：「什么时候开始，红包变成了 KPI？」 贴文一出，瞬间引起网友关注 ▼ 还回去咯 ▼ 红包只是一个祝福，懂得感恩啦 农历新年，本来是团圆和祝福的节日。红包的意义，是祝愿平安、健康和好运。金额多少，从来都不是重点。 一句简单的「谢谢」，往往比红包里的数字更有分量。 时代在变，但基本的尊重与感恩不该改变。愿我们在收下红包的同时，也记得收下那份真心。

The drug lord was the Mexican government’s biggest prize yet to show the Trump administration in its efforts to crack down on the cartels, and his death was met with a forceful reaction from the cartel, known by its Spanish initials CJNG.

 Try to be smart → research → want best value
 Fear missing out → “maybe higher option is safer/better” Spend more Later realize cheaper option was enough
 Regret → guilt → self-blame
 Next purchase → overthink even more
 That loop is exhausting. Anyone would feel sad after repeating it for 10 years.

                              <span>Not sure if this is aloud on here but 
 I’m 20, starting college in five months(paying for it by working during school), and have $30k in savings, $17k in gold/silver, and $1.6k in my Roth IRA. I haven’t contributed to my 2025 Roth yet (deadline April 15, 2026) and already put $1.6k toward 2026. My goal is early financial freedom, but I prefer staying cash-heavy and wanted $35k saved before college. I’m deciding whether to use some savings to max my 2025 Roth contribution.

                              <span>So I make 218k and get a bonus based on performance. I have no debt and my expenses are low. I max out my 401k, buy $100 of VOO weekly, and contribute to a 529 account. I get killed on taxes because I only get the standard deduction.
 I feel fortunate but hate my job so...
 What can I invest in or buy now, while I can still tolerate my job, that could help build wealth or another income stream for the future? Buy a business? real estate? Investment options? 
 I&#x27;m thinking about buying / investing in a business that could scale. 
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Around a year ago, I was sick for a prolonged period, so I decided to go to my university&#x27;s health center. The university advertises that students who take x or more credits (which I qualfiied for) &quot;do not pay copays or coinsurance for provider visits at [name]! &quot; . I also asked the front-desk if/how much would be billed to insurance, and they said that it should be covered for students. It turned out to be the flu, and the only thing that the medical staff member did was give me a flu and covid test. The next day, I am completely fine and recover on my own after the week-ish of abnormal shivers and sickness. I would have never went to the student care if they provided price transparency instead of deceiving students.
 I then get a bill for ~$400, and although insurance adjusted it by a bit, it&#x27;s still $300. It&#x27;s not covered by insurance because my insurance has a high deductible.
 I have heard that you can negotiate even if you have insurance, so long as you are willing to pay immediately. If they bring the bill down to a REASONABLE amount ($100-150), I would be able to pay immediately.
 Can someone please provide me with some tips to negotiate this urgent care visit given the circumstances of me being a student (I still am a student) and it being health services provided by the university?

 I am a CPA and am working in a company that has been bought out by a pe firm. I am not sure if they will layoff but we were told if that happens there will be severance. It’s a wonderful company but I figured that starting q2 I will start looking for another job as I see people who have been here over 10 years resigning.
 I have about 60k in an emergency und and this would cover about 1 year of expenses for me. I have 72k ina 401k. I know I am behind on retirement savings so I am now saving the max for 401k and I save about 2 k every month. My salary is 170k and there is a 55k bonus that would be paid out next march. Is this an ok savings rate? My mortgage is under 80k, at 3.75%.
 Also is 60k a decent emergency fund? This would cover 1 year of expenses for me. Do you think I should just pay off the mortgage? My monthly mortgage payment is 2000, of which 500 is property tax.

 For reference, I have some pre-tax money in a rollover IRA, and a tiny amount in my employer&#x27;s current 401(k) but I am now in a position where I can more meaningfully contribute to my retirement accounts. Any advice?

                              <span>I’m interested in buying a vacation home. I’m offering 330k. I have 330k in savings but then I would not have any money leftover. I need some additional funds for closing costs, repairs, and furniture. Interest rates are 6% right now. Should I take out a mortgage or get a 50k loan from my 401k? I could also not do renovations right away (new master bath and kitchen) and save up for them later but there could be some things that need to be repaired in the beginning (electrical, appliances). I have a good amount already saved for retirement. My salary is 109k a year with stable long term employment. I am married and my husband has a lot saved up but refuses to contribute (but he covers expenses for our primary house).

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I&#x27;m a new grad, 22 years old, and I need some advice on what to contribute my money to because I&#x27;m getting a little lost! My total salary is 140k with 25k stock, and I&#x27;m in NYC. 
 I get access to a 401k with max $12,500 employer contribution, ESPP that I can contribute 1-15% of my paycheck to, and a HSA. What is worth prioritizing my money towards first? I was trying to max out my 401k, then $200 per paycheck to HSA then I&#x27;m lost about ESPP. How much should I be trying to put towards ESPP? I&#x27;m still trying to get a budget figured out. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have $14,631 in credit card debt that I&#x27;m struggling to pay off. The one card has $6,659.92 and APR is 26.49%, another card with $7,068.72 has an APR of 21.49%, the last card has $741.66 with $35.99% APR. I make payments to all of these monthly, but I just can&#x27;t seem to make a dent with the interest piling on top. My car is going to need replaced soon, so I&#x27;m panicking about having all of these lines of credit open and not being able to have a decent downpayment on a new (to me, but still used) car. I can&#x27;t afford $500/month in a car payment, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out if consolidating my debt is worth it at all or what I should do here. I never learned financial literacy and I&#x27;m trying to teach myself and I&#x27;m struggling HARD. :(

                              <span>In a family where the father is the primary breadwinner, does a mother working provide any financial benefit if her paycheck is less than or equal to the cost of childcare?
 My partner and I couldn&#x27;t agree, he says both need to work but I struggle to understand how this would be of any benefit to the family unit. 
 Thank you for your input!

                              <span>Hi everyone, this is weird and hopefully makes sense.
 I was alerted today by both Chase and Experian that a dormant credit card account with Chase was suddenly active. Looking into Experian, the charged amount was $3300. Of note, I recently signed up for Experian alerts after freezing my credit. The account says it was opened in 2010 on Experian. I have no record of this account and when I talked with a Chase representative, they say my only credit card with them has a zero balance. I typed in the last 4 of the account in question and Chase says it’s not an account with them. It says I am an authorized user on Experian, my parents don’t have any Chase cards and I’ve never been on any of their cards as a User. Same with other relatives
 So far so I have: - sent a secure message to Chase with pictures from Experian of this account in question - filed a dispute with all 3 credit bureaus
 What the heck is going on? It doesn’t even seem like this account exists with Chase! Chase was super unhelpful and confused as well and I’ve been unable to talk to Experian. FYI I didn’t freeze my credit for any particular reason other than my mom telling me she froze her credit.

 If you’ve tracked usage with a smart meter or utility breakdown, that would be amazing to hear about!

                              <span>Hi, I opened up a 360 Checking account with Capital One a few weeks ago with the intent of using it a secondary account to send wire transfers from since you are able to do it online instead of in-person like my other bank requires (the closest branch is very far away since I moved. However, whenever I go to the &quot;wire transfer&quot; section via the Capital One dashboard I get an error stating &quot;this account is too new&quot;. I called support and they just said &quot;they think its like 30-60 days, maybe&quot; but couldn&#x27;t give me a definitive answer. 
 So tl;dr: does anyone know how long until my Capital One 360 Checking account needs to be open for before I can send a wire transfer? Thanks!

                              <span>I’m about to work two jobs. My “main“ job is a part time job at a grocery store, which has been cutting my hours and the store director gets in a mood whenever we stay over so more often than not it’s not an option. They never promote any full time workers, so getting full time is extremely unlikely. I told myself I either need to find a better job or a second job.
 So far the only other place to have contacted me back and hire me is another grocery store. I’ll be working morning and mid shifts at the first one, closing at the second.
 Issue is, the hours of my first job fluctuate— I can be working less then 20 hours for months, but then suddenly be working over 30 hours, six days a week, the next couple weeks. Which means I can be working 50+ hours some weeks with two jobs. I also have my benefits and paid vacations at the first job that I’m reluctant to lose right away and start over at another job.
 However, I need the finances. I’m in student loan debt, have to pay for my own groceries, am trying to move out of a toxic household, and would need to eventually pay for other expenses later on. Working at my inconsistent first job alone isn’t enough anymore if I’m going to survive off only $200 each week on my low weeks.
 I am worried about burn out, though, and the lack of a social life and time to myself. Since my off days are inconsistent at both jobs, I can’t guarantee any days off unless I request off (and since I’m opening at the one, closing at the other, my whole day will be booked). I am going to see how it goes and if I can’t handle it, I’ll quit one of the jobs. I’ll also continue looking for better jobs and side hustles in the meantime. 
 But I just wanted to ask if it’s worth doing two jobs in my circumstances? I know the answer seems obvious. But I’m just worried about burn out. At the very least, any tips on how to endure and not feel so burn out?

                              <span>I have a 2015 Silverado with 139,380 miles. I owe about 11k on the truck. The transmission is slipping and the transmission fluid is dark in color (lighter brown/black) and can smell it burning. it made a trip hauling a 12 foot U-Haul trailer 1,300 miles like this with no problem. So I figured if the tranny was going to go out it would have then. My transmission cooler lines are also leaking, and I have an oil leak. or I can pay 4k and someone offered to buy it for 7k and just get out of the loan by paying the 4k and get something else in a few months. The cost to repair everything will probably be around 8,000$ which I really don’t have right now.
 Do I sell it and spend 4 k to get out of the loan and eventually get a new vehicle, or spend the 8 k to fix it while I owe 111k and it has 140k miles?

Wife and I will continue to work but with the current economy and our plan to hopefully conceive soon, we want to have a good cushion. Contemplating though if $85,000 is too much to just be sitting in HYSA?

                              <span>I know this is probably common knowledge for folks... but I always figured there was a limit to how high insurance companies will jack your rates over time. I was wrong, and hopefully this will help some others.
 I&#x27;ve been noticing my escrow payments slowly climbing over the years. there have been some large fires in my area that destroyed a lot of homes as well as tax increases, so I chalked it up to that for a long time. Payments had gotten to ridiculous levels lately (north of $1k per month through Liberty Mutual), so I finally decided to shop around.
 I ended up reducing my premium by 75% for significantly better coverage by switching to another company... Not naming names since I don&#x27;t want this to seem like an ad. just a warning. When I called to cancel, the retention agent had the gall to insinuate it was my fault for not calling earlier to complain. apparently, loyalty for nearly a decade and no claims filed isn&#x27;t enough to get a low rate. 
 tl;dr - if you haven&#x27;t checked your insurance rates lately, do it. They might be boiling you like the proverbial frog. I don&#x27;t know if all companies do this, but screw Liberty Mutual. Oh, and your commercials are annoying.

 I am reeling with disastrous revelations and need some advice on my finances.
 My husband and I are in our 30s and have decently paying jobs.
 3 months ago I found out that my husband has a gambling addiction, and has drained our entire savings towards gambling. He has also opened 5 new credit cards in my name (without me knowing) and has run up a net total of USD 75,000 on them. He has then filed for bankruptcy too - I saw the paperwork , that’s how I found how things are. I got no notification that my spouse had filed for bankruptcy, or maybe he intercepted any notification.
 When I confronted him he got angry, trashed the room, pushed me and our …</span>

                              <span>Malaysia’s Islamist party is taking control of the opposition coalition following months of internal rift, which could increase its influence and disrupt the political landscape ahead of a general election.
 The Perikatan Nasional alliance named Ahmad Samsuri Mokhtar from the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party as its chairman, a move that will embolden PAS and allow it to assert its dominance.
 PAS&#x27;s leadership of the opposition coalition may lead to a period of competitive conservatism, with a clash of Islamic narratives between PAS&#x27;s more dogmatic approach and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim&#x27;s moderate Islam.

                              <span>Hi everyone! 👋 My name is Narges, and this is my sweet girl, Milo. ❤️ I rescued her back in July 2025, and she has been living with us since then. She is now 9 months old. Unfortunately, I have to rehome her, and I&#x27;m desperately seeking helpful advice on how to make this process easier for both her and myself.
 I&#x27;ve been planning to immigrate to Australia from Malaysia for a few months now. While I&#x27;m excited about this new chapter in my life, I am also heartbroken that I need to rehome my cat. I can&#x27;t take her with me due to the strict pet relocation rules in Australia, and Malaysia is not an approved country for relocating pets. Even if it was, I wouldn&#x27;t have the financial means to cover the expenses.
 Has anyone here gone through a similar situation? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>41F, single, no kiddos. I’m trying to understand if I can buy a $700k home or whether I would be house poor. I could get a house now for $500-$600k but those are all in areas I don’t really want to live. I currently have $300k ready for a down payment but thinking I may need $400k saved to make the loan more suitable. My retirement is currently around $700k, I make $160k annual with a $50k bonus. No debt. It may be more of a wants versus needs conversation but I’m curious if others think this is too much to spend on a house with my numbers?

                              <span>I (19M) plan on buying my first car before summer. My parents are going to pitch in about 1-2k. Me and my dad have been looking at auctions for a car thats not too old. 
 I’ve been driving for 3 years but it has been my parents car that they never really used. But now that im in college I want my own set of wheels.
 My dad says I should find a cheap car around 4-5k and finance it to also build some credit since I don’t yet have a score.

                              <span>Im in the planning/estimating phase of a new home build. 
 So here&#x27;s the situation. I already own the land and there is a house on the lot. We live in it but it needs everything. Roof, mold mitigation, every wall is plaster, subfloor are warped, electric and plumbing are shot, hvac is not installed right, every window and door is clapped, foundation is crumbling, Ghosts ect.
 I could throw 200k at it and we would still have problems. Zillow estimate puts us at 350k but houses around here sell for like 600k+ and we&#x27;re in a primo spot so tbd on what we will appraise at.
 The house sits on a 5 acer plot and I want to build a new house next to it and demo the old one. 
 I have a background in engineering and I manage contractors for a living so I want to be my own GC. The house will be a barndo. I have quotes for the kit, construction, site work and ill bid out the other trades when we&#x27;re ready for rough in work once all the framing is done.
 Question is should I take out a construction loan? I was looking into FFBKC since they let you be your own GC and lend for the barndo concept 
 Or should I take out a HELOC and borrow what&#x27;s needed. Or cash out refinance and use the money from that.
 I have about 100k cash for this venture and no debt. I make 145k annually.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I got into a dispute with ATT because they of a trade in. I turned in my phone to upgrade to an s25 and they said it would cover the bill of the s25. After six months I was still being billed the full price. After several calls they said they never got it. I called the store and they said they don’t have records dating back six months. I recorded all these conversations. I got in touch with someone from their “office of the president” who played phone tag with me for a week and then claimed the matter was resolved in an email. 
 I got sick of it and went to Verizon. ATT sent me a bill for 800. They charged my credit card which I disputed because I did nott consent to that charge. I logged in to my att portal and it shows I have a negative balance of $765. 
 What is the best course of action here?

                              <span>So I currently hold over $10k in a HYSA. My living expenses are roughly $1k-1.5k a month (renting from friend&#x27;s parent) and I make on average $3.2k a month (Contract work). Got nailed by taxes pretty hard ($6k), and I&#x27;m looking at how to plan moving forward outside of memorizing the tax code for my state lol.
 My original plan was to set up a sinking fund to cover moving out expenses (10%) and put 15% into the Rath. However that plan needs to be put on pause for obvious reasons. Now I could dip into my efund and simply adjust said plan, with the 15% going into rebuilding it and the 10% going into the IRA, but while these taxes are definitely scary, I think I can pay them off with monthly payments and by filing an extension. I had no issues paying them off last year, so I don&#x27;t have a negative reputation with the IRS. That and the last thing I need is to pay off taxes only for an actual emergency to happen.
 What do yall think? Is this a sound approach to dealing with these expenses? Would you deem taxes a suitable emergency? Should I drop everything (including the Rath) to pay these off (Baby Step 2)? Would love your feedback.
 If I don&#x27;t respond immediately, I&#x27;m on the way home. Thanks everyone!

                              <span>I am getting ready to sell my house. My house is paid off. I would love to be able to buy my next house before I sell mine for these reasons:
  
Inventory in my area is very limited. I am concerned that I will be hard pressed to find a suitable place in a reasonable time.
 
I would like to move gradually.
 
 If I take money from a IRA for a down payment on a new home, I have to repay the IRA within 60 days or incur a $50,000. tax hit. I think that’s too risky. 
 I spoke to a lender who recommended the following: I believe the best option for P would be obtaining a new mortgage, using her retirement funds for the down payment, &amp; adding a recast option to her mortgage.
 Ideally, P should try to sell her current home around the same time as she closes on her new home so we can use these sale …</span>

                              <span>I know the topic of including international stocks has come up a few times this week, but I finally made the change. A few years ago I read The Simple Path to Wealth and started following it&#x27;s principles, not perfectly, but as well as I could in my situation with a young family. I have been watching VXUS over the past year due to seeing an interview with J.L. where he mentioned that he would tell his daughter to watch out for international stocks starting to outperform U.S. stocks due to changes in the global economy. When I saw his blog post this month, I decided to include international stocks as well and I intend to be invested in them long term. 
 I saw another post here that recommended moving all stocks to VT for it&#x27;s simplicity and just let it ride. However, isn&#x27;t cost also a major factor? I wanted to keep an eye on costs and implement this in the most cost effective way possible. What I did is take a portion from VTI and move it to VXUS, which will give me a better expense ratio and have very similar performance as just holding VT. VT has an expense ratio of .06%, VXUS is .05%, and VTI is .03%. So, for example, if I have a total of $10,000 invested with approximately $6,000 in VTI and $4,000 (about 60% U.S. and 40% international) I&#x27;m only paying .03% for the bulk of my stock portfolio and .05% for the international component instead of .06% to hold everything in one fund. It&#x27;s easy for me to rebalance to keep about the same ratios as VT as well because I add to the fund throughout the year and can add a little more to VTI or more to VXUS to keep in line with VT. What are some of the arguments against this approach? Is it just for simplicity and not tinkering with your investments?

 Paid deposit, signed, took truck home. When time came to pay, we hadn’t received any information on the bank yet. We called the dealer and they had us come back in since they worked a better deal out with the same bank- cool whatever better deal
 Now apparently our payment is due tomorrow, but nothing is finalized at the bank STILL.
 Our temp tag expires tomorrow as well. Not too sure what to do or go around this.

                              <span>My husband and I divorced. He left me as beneficiary on work life insurance however I’m noted as “spouse “. 
 Will this be a problem? Do I advise the company? I believe they want a copy of marriage certificate
 Thanks for reply’s

                              <span>Last summer my father made a poor choice when he needed a new roof - he went through Erie Roofing, financed through Goodleap, and paid probably twice as much as he should have. He passed away unexpectedly a few weeks ago and we don’t know what to do about the loan. He was the only name on the loan, we have no estate because he didn’t have many assets or money. Nearly all of his bank accounts had me listed in trust and the house is in his and my mother’s name (she is still with us.) my mother is on Social Security and it may not be enough for her to live off of and keep the home, although we are going to try, but the loan will make it nearly impossible. I hate the idea of not paying a debt, but is there any option that allows us to have the loan forgiven due to his death?
 Also - the salesman for Erie specifically told my parents that if he were to die the loan would not have to be repaid, I feel like that was a predatory move on his part and not fully accurate.

                              <span>I recently bought an off plan studio apartment in Dubai. specifically Dubailand Residence Complex. There are goijg to be major changes and upgrades to the area by 2030. Metros being built, community filling up, 3 malls, a city dedicated to students right above it, new etihad rail, etc... huge developments. price was 548k aed which is 149k usd give or take. now, the studio is 319 sqft and its projected to get done in q3 2028. Current rent there is 45k aed a year (12250 usd/year). 
 The eay its going with inflation and general uptrend of studio rent prices/the upgrades to the area I mentioned earlier everyone is predicting rent to be 55k aed a year (roughly 15k usd) so the roi seems good. 
 payment plan is 20% upfront and 1500 usd a month until completion which will be 50% of the property then after that ill have 20% more saved up meaning ill have to get mortgage for the other 30% (probably going to end hp being a 3 year mortgage on 4% fee). 
 All that said, im 35 and have a small family. This is my introduction to the real estate investment side of things. Was this a smart decision or a bad one?

Didn’t start making “real” money until I was 26 because after I graduated college in 2019 I worked in EMS making $16/hr for 2 years prior to going to PA school.
 My 2025 gross income was about $154k between my full time job and per diem job where I do an extra 1-2 shifts a month. Currently have $165k of student loans left (was $208k in 2023 between PA school and undergrad, so about ~40k paid off in 3 years), highest interest rate is 6.5%. I have $58,495 in my 401k where I have a 6% employer match and just increased my contribution from 10% to 15% to get close to maxing it out.

                              <span>I have 4 credit cards. I use them all. One is my main card which I typically put 3-5k on every month and then pay it off in full on time every month.
 The others I use for subscriptions and odd purchases here and there, probably a total of about $600 across those cards.
 My total utilization never passes 10%. I applied for a new card because my main one is pretty barebones and doesnt offer many rewards. I found one that has decent rewards for travel and dining, so I applied.
 Credit score: 798
 Total unused credit: 72k
 Current balance across all cards: $3200
 Gross Annual income (combined with wife): 312k
 I got approved and they extended me a $5.1k credit line. This is far lower than my current card. Im just confused about why it would be so low.
 I spoke with a coworker and he said its probably because credit companies want me to carry a balance and they dont want someone who pays it off in full every month. Is this the case?

 Today I logged in to my account just because, and see there is a refinance loan open on my account dated 2/18. I didnt ask to apply for a loan i didn’t say i wanted a loan I clearly stated I just wanted info and in the call it was stablished I needed to work on my credit and other things before I did anything… is this legal or even normal?? Did this person create a loan application without my consent?? Is this what happens when you call to ask about info? 
 I did not call to apply for a loan AT ALL!!! Let alone to refinance my 2021 3.25% rate. I don’t know what to do!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve spent a few hours trying to wrap my head around why people online (see here) are often adamant that a traditional 401(k) and Roth IRA is the way to go - especially with how high the praise is for the latter - yet I don&#x27;t often see people talking about doing both a Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA. If the Roth IRA is so great, why wouldn&#x27;t you want to also do a Roth 401(k)? It seems like they adhere to the same taxation rules, so is there something substantially different about Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA accounts that make them fundamentally different animals that I&#x27;m just not aware of? Maybe it&#x27;s simply for diversification? The only real difference I&#x27;ve heard is that Roth IRAs typically allow for more aggressive investment options and the ability to withdraw contributions easier, but that&#x27;s about it.
 My job allows me to contribute to a traditional and/or Roth 401(k) with a match up to 4% - my understanding is if I were to switch to a Roth percentage, their match would still go to a traditional, pre-tax account instead - and I&#x27;m currently maxing it out on the traditional side while maxing a separate Roth IRA. I&#x27;m not uncomfortable with that arrangement, but it still irks me not understanding what makes a Roth 401(k) &quot;bad&quot; but a Roth IRA &quot;good&quot; in the eyes of a lot of people (I know it&#x27;s largely subjective and relative to individuals&#x27; goals, but you know what I mean), when they&#x27;re like... the same thing as far as I can tell.
 Thanks in advance for any information.

                              <span>I&#x27;m moving out of my parents house at 25 into a 1 bed 1 bath apartment. The place is really nice but the rent is just shy of $1600/month. My normal take home monthly is about $4200. I know this is well above the recommended 1/3rd of net to be put towards rent. However, I have absolutely no debt whatsoever. I&#x27;ve spent the last 4 years aggressively paying off all of my student loans while living at home and also own my car. I&#x27;m pretty confident I can make it on $2600 a month and will still be able to save some money. I mostly just want a nice place to live. Has anyone done something like this successfully? Or is this a terrible idea?

                              <span>Im 24, my knowledge on finances are slim and I am terrified for my mom.
 She is in her late 60’s, working overtime just to survive, going through a divorce with my dad and has a new worrying intake of alcohol.
 Shes started on dating apps and lost $6000 by sending it to her “boyfriend” overseas. I didnt know until it happened, uploaded his picture to google and found the guy her scammer was posing as. This was around 6 months ago, that $6000 was basically her whole savings. I put parental controls on her phone which she was okay with and it worked for a while but she decided she wanted to try again.
 She showed me a check her new “boyfriend” sent to her house, for $900,000 in his name, which was obviously fake. She didnt know it was fake but was worried so she showed it to me. I used the same method and found who this scammer was posing as.
 Do you have any tips on protecting her finances?
 *Edit*
 She realizes her mistakes and has been asking me for help. I dont want to take complete control of her finances, I just want to help her not loose large sums of money.

Governments from across the Islamic world have condemned remarks by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, suggesting it would “be fine” for Israel to claim a broad swath of the Middle East.
Huckabee, an evangelical Christian pastor and former Arkansas governor, has long been an outspoken supporter of Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territories.

Searches are expected to continue today at Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s previous home – Royal Lodge, in Windsor – as calls grow for a probe into the former prince’s links with Jeffrey Epstein.
Lucy Hough speaks to the Guardian’s police and crime correspondent, Vikram Dodd, about what could be next for Andrew here:
If the government bring forward this bill with the support of the King then we will back it. We have to be realistic. Andrew is the eighth in line to the throne, so there’s no chance of him becoming our monarch.
And so parliament really should be focused on things that are of more importance to the public, whether that’s the economy, crime, the health service, immigration. But if the bill does come before parliament, then we’ll support it.

The mother of a student who was killed in the 2023 Nottingham attacks has said she will “fight to the bitter end” to get to the truth of how Valdo Calocane was free to attack, before the beginning of a public inquiry into the incident.
Barnaby Webber and Grace O’Malley-Kumar, 19-year-old students, and 65-year-old caretaker Ian Coates were fatally stabbed by Calocane on 13 June 2023 in a frenzied attack. Early the next day, Calocane drove a van into pedestrians Wayne Birkett, Sharon Miller and Marcin Gawronski, leaving all three with severe and life-changing injuries.

Although the US president often spends weekends at the ocean resort, he was at the White House in Washington during this incident, as was first lady Melania Trump.

High-level talks with the US administration over the threat of increased tariffs are under way as the UK government says it wants “the best possible deal” for UK companies.

In comments posted on his Truth Social platform, the US president described Rice – who served as national security adviser to Barack Obama and UN ambassador and White House adviser under Joe Biden – as a “political hack” and accused her of having “no talent or skills”.

The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, admitted the system of plan 2 loans had “problems” but suggested the government’s priority would be maintenance grants for poorer students, rather than tackling the high interest rates.

Fewer than one in 10 boys aged 14 to 16 in the UK read daily, according to research, which found reading for pleasure was being crowded out of teenage lives by schoolwork, screens and sports.
While reading declines for both boys and girls in early adolescence, there are “signs of recovery” among girls in later teenage years, but boys’ engagement remains persistently low, according to the National Literacy Trust (NLT).

A Guardian analysis of government records has found that the vast majority – 77% – of people who entered deportation proceedings for the first time in 2025 had no criminal conviction, exposing a stark gap between the Trump administration’s rhetoric and reality.
Within days of Donald Trump’s inauguration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) trotted out a phrase that his surrogates would come to use over and over again: “the worst of the worst.”
Fewer than half of the people in the data (40%) had any criminal charge against them, and only 23% had a conviction.
Of those who did have a criminal conviction, nearly half were for non-violent traffic and immigration offenses.
Traffic offenses alone made up nearly 30% of the convictions, the largest category by far.
Some 9% of criminal convictions were for assault, while only 1% were for sexual assault and just 0.5% were for homicide.

Scotland Yard is using AI tools supplied by the US tech company Palantir to monitor staff behaviour in an attempt to root out failing officers, the Guardian has learned.
The Metropolitan police has previously declined to confirm or deny whether it used technology supplied by the company, which also works for the Israeli military and Donald Trump’s ICE operation. It has now confirmed that it is using Palantir’s AI to analyse internal data about sickness levels, absences from duty and overtime patterns in an effort to identify potential shortcomings in professional standards.

Deranque was beaten to death in Lyon last week during a fight with alleged hard-left activists.

                              <span>Hi all,
 24M fresh grad here. Entered corporate last year and currently earning a take home of ~ RM4.2k/month or RM50k/year. I am very lucky that I live with my parents and no need to pay for rent. Mom is a stay at home housewife so she usually cooks me lunch for me to bawak bekal to office. Same goes for dinner, as she cooks for the whole family.
 I am also naturally frugal and dont spend much on clothes or outing. No financial commitment as well. No girlfriend, car, or any student loan. I also commute to work by public transport everyday. So technically I only spend about RM200 out of my pocket every month for Netflix, PS+, late night kopitiam etc. This means I save RM4k/month on the regular after deducting all my expenses.
 My dad takes home about RM10k per month, with a fully paid hous…</span>

                              <span>I just found out that Robert Kiyosaki is coming to Malaysia on Feb 27 and I’m not sure if I should attend.
 I used to be into personal finance and investing (crypto and stocks), but I paused everything for 3 years while I was in Australia. I didn’t follow financial news much during that time. Now I’m back working and trying to reconnect, but I feel rusty.
 The ticket is about USD150. For those who’ve attended his talks before, is it worth it? Is it practical or mostly motivation? And does he usually repeat the same ideas from his books, or does he share new insights?
 Thanks 🙏

                              <span>I need help, with budgeting. Gonna get a real job soon, in puchong, will rent in subang (20+ min travel, by bike). Is my budget good, or is there possible improvements.
 Net salary (after deduction + parents) - 2000, excluding meal allowance(400)
 Rent - 600 (include utils)
 Food - 800 (including groceries, twice a month)
 Fuel + maintenance - 90
 Saving + Investment - 300
 Internet - 50 
 Total - 1840
 I might need to increase the internet, since the room im renting has no wifi. I have no costly hobbies, thats why i decided to topup on food. Really choosy with the room, as i rather have a literal empty room if its squeaky clean. Rarely cook, mostly eat outside, this budget mostly derived from my current spending as an intern.

                              <span>Hi guys. I just wanna ask about how should i do to improve my current financial worries (sorry, i only can tag 1, i wish i can tag more flairs). Btw, i&#x27;m not good in english, so please bare with me.
 I just turned to 40yo this year. Currently i do part time grab + part time stock trader with income around 3k-5k per month. Below is my current assets, liabilities and monthly spending budget
 Assets:
 ASB - 300k
 EPF - 200k
 Saving - 10k
 Liability:
 House loan - 270k
 Spending:
 Monthly loan payment - 1.5k
 Water and eletric - 300
 Family internet - 300 (include home and internet mobile data)
 Transport - 500
 Groceries - 600
 Balance - 50% to my wife, 50% saving.
 Tbh, i just tired on doing this part time jobs. So i was thinking of looking for jobs. I have degree in accounting. I used to work as an executive of one of sme company till i got vss during covid end of 2019. So for these years, i worked multiple jobs like grab for time being at that time. On year 2021, i drawn into trading stock and investment and become stock trader till today. Unfortunately, i just felt tired at some point, especially when you didn&#x27;t get to meet your monthly end commitments.
 So i was thinking of looking for jobs, but from what i read and watch, employment is really bad, even for newly fresh graduate. And even i don&#x27;t think i will get iv after applying jobs based on my age and status. 
 My apology if my post here is a bit &quot;mess up&quot;, i dunno the correct word. Anyway, please help me.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I’m from Sarawak, and I would like to respectfully seek guidance regarding a family heirloom . It is an old Iban Kain Kumbu textile that has been passed down through approximately 4–5 generations in my family.... l am not sure but would like to ask an expert about this!!
 Family lineage timeline:
 • My late great-great grandmother • Passed down to my late great grandmother • Then to my grandmother • Then to my mother • Now in my possession 
 According to my mother’s oral history, this textile was worn by an ancestor named Niang Inik Kantan. The longhouse origin is unfortunately unknown as most elders in our family have passed away sadly no information was to further explaining more about this Kain Kumbu
 The piece appears:
 • Handwoven • Naturally dyed (earth tones, deep browns, muted red/blue) • Smaller in size compared to modern 1970s–1990s Kain Kumbu • In good structural condition • Has a natural woody scent consistent with aged textile storage 
 I am genuinely seeking:
 1. Advice on authentication. 2. How to verify age (pre-1900? 1800s?). 3. Whether museum textile experts in Sarawak or Malaysia would be appropriate to consult. 4. General historical context of early Kain Kumbu weaving. 
 I deeply respect its cultural and spiritual value, and I want to approach this carefully and correctly. Because this is from our family heirloom and been on generations...
 Any guidance from historians, textile experts, collectors, or museum professionals would be sincerely appreciated.
 Thank you.

                              <span>So recently got an Insta and for Monoloop in Amcorp Mall, PJ. Promoted itself as having a large collection of old cameras, vinyl and other collectibles.
 Went there and yup, they weren&#x27;t kidding about the huge racks and piles of camera gear strewn all around. 
 Ngl, it was quite fun sorting around the racks and seeing what gems I can pick out. 
 I wonder, are ther any other places like this around KL? Thrift stores, garage sales, etc?

 Been tracking pickleball games worldwide and the international growth has been wild. From June 2025 to Feb 2026, Malaysia surged from 4th all the way to #1 outside the US.
 Over 10,000 games tracked across 60+ countries. Happy to answer any questions about the data!
 For those curious — here&#x27;s the same chart with the US included:

                              <span>im in this situation where my dad would beat me up w no remorse and my mother would just stand there and let him do it. today was my last straw. he strangled me and tried to kill me. when i wanted to leave that abusive home but he threaten to file a missing police report.
 im 22F and i left that house and trying to find a place currently w the savings i have currently.
 i have a few questions if anyone can give me advice
  
legally can my parents and the police do anything to drag me back? going back to abusive parents is the last thing i want to do. id rather die on my own term then their hands
 i am currently doing acca but im planning to drop out because my mental health cant take this anymore. i have a degree in accounting in one of the top unis in the world but little to no job exprince. since im going to be finding a place and living on my own, i will need a job (currently living in airbnbs and crashing at friends houses) is me dropping out of acca to prioritise getting a job a good decision rn? (keep in mind if i dont do this, ill be force to live w abusive parents)
 is it possible for me to get a fresh grad accounting job in less than a month with just my degree and that supports me (rental and food, i do not own a car or any have any loans)
 lastly, as of rn idk what to do, should i go police and report that my dad tried to kill me by strangling me? im scared if i do, theyll just send me back to my parents. do i stay quiet and try to find a fresh grad job asap and cut contact w them completely?
  
any advice would be appreciated

                              <span>Don&#x27;t get an expensive master&#x27;s degree unless you truly need it for career advancement (i.e., you have a very concrete and realistic plan of how you will pay for it). 
 I am a teacher at a private boarding school in Massachusetts. A lot of my colleagues found themselves in the workforce for a few years, usually as teachers, then decided that their life felt stagnant and got a master&#x27;s degree from places like Columbia or whatever. They figured it was a logical next move as a typical &quot;striver&quot; who wants to achieve the next milestone in life, assuming it would lead to new opportunities. Underrated fact: even at places like Harvard, many of these master&#x27;s degrees are not particularly selective and will enroll almost any baseline smart/competent person - they&#x27;re a cash cow for the university primarily used to fund their PhD programs! 
 Anyways, these people end up in serious debt and forego earnings while getting the degrees, sometimes in excess of $100,000. And what did they do with their degree? They went back to teaching - basically the exact same job they already had with the same earning potential. 
 I&#x27;m curious if this is a pattern in other lines of work - do any of your coworkers also randomly get masters degree at enormous expense that they don&#x27;t put to good use? In my opinion you should only go to graduate school for a profession that truly requires the credential (JD, MD, etc), or if you get it funded (via a PhD program or through your employer).

                              <span>At 6:40am there was a $0 charge from a FedEx Office Print &amp; Ship Center many states away from me in Collierville, TN. I wasn&#x27;t up at that time and the location isn&#x27;t open yet, and I plan to call them... since I&#x27;m not shipping anything and I don&#x27;t have my card on file with FedEx, how concerned should I be?

                              <span>My mother was given US savings bonds from the woman she cared for as a gift, a substantial amount. These were purchased decades ago, back in the 60s-80s. My mom never did anything with them, and the lady ended up passing away about 10 years ago. We recently found them when she was going through some attic stuff. 
 Her husband passed away a decade before she did, and she had no children. Should we just throw them away?
 EDIT: These bonds are not in my mom&#x27;s name, the lady who passed away just handed them to my mom over the years as gifts.

                              <span>Hi everyone, 26M looking for some advice on whether my current investment approach makes sense for my age and goals.
 I have about RM2.8k per month to invest, and this is my current monthly allocation:
  
ASB: RM1,000/month
 ETFs: RM800/month (I’ve only recently started getting into ETFs)
 Crypto: RM1,000/month (currently higher to take advantage of the bear market)
  
Current portfolio breakdown:
  
ASB: RM120k
 Crypto: RM15k (Only BTC &amp; ETH)
 Liquid: RM15k
  
My goal is long-term wealth growth, and I’m comfortable with some level of risk since I’m still young.
 I’d really appreciate opinions on:
  
Whether this overall strategy looks reasonable for a 26 year old
 If I should be more conservative or more aggressive
 Thoughts on the split between ASB, ETFs, and crypto, especially as I’m just starting with ETFs. Should I put more into ETF to build it up ASAP and slow down on ASB?
  
Thanks in advance for any feedback!

                              <span>There&#x27;s quite a lot of apps to do investment in. So I wonder which ones are the best to put your money in. I&#x27;ve aldy have money in asnb and trying to learn moomoo. And I just tried the Ryt Bank. There&#x27;s also bursa gold. So it&#x27;s quite a lot to managed. So I just want to limit to a few. I know its good to expand but sometimes it&#x27;s hard to keep track. How do you keep track of all your investments.

                              <span>Trying to decide if it’s better for me to rent out my place/rent elsewhere or move in (KL area). 
 Moving in means a good chunk of my income goes to my mortgage. If I rent it out and rent elsewhere to live then I get more cashflow. But also trying to get a sense of how much Malaysians spend on their mortgage/rent. 
 Please do not provide answers like “you should spend 25%-30%” on your mortgage. I am highly aware of this.

Bolivia’s long-serving socialist former leader, Evo Morales, reappeared on Thursday in his political stronghold of the tropics after almost seven weeks of unexplained absence, endorsing candidates for upcoming regional elections and quieting rumours he had fled the country in the wake of the US seizure of his ally, Venezuela’s ex-president Nicolás Maduro.
The weeks of hand-wringing over Morales’ fate showed how little the Andean country knows about what’s happening in the remote Chapare region, where the former president has spent the past year evading an arrest warrant on human trafficking charges, and how vulnerable it is to fears about US president Donald Trump’s potential future foreign escapades.

The siege and capture of the Sudanese city of El Fasher by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces group last October bore “the hallmarks of genocide”, a UN-mandated fact-finding mission has said.

                              <span>在大马赚钱不容易，她好不容易月入五位数，却换来满身压力。 近日，大马一名女子在 Facebook《XUAN》发文表示，她在大公司打拼多年，从月薪 RM2,800 一路做到月入超过 RM20,000，她本以为事业稳定后，感情也会越来越好，没想到两人的距离却越来越远。 她说，从小家庭背景不好，不想再经历过口袋里只剩 RM30，却还要等三个星期才发薪水的日子。那种不安感，让她对「没钱」特别害怕。为了不再回到过去，她几乎一年无休地工作，用时间和健康换收入。别人看到的是光鲜亮丽，但只有她知道，那是无数个熬夜换来的成绩。 男友是她的第二段感情。刚毕业时，两人都在努力工作。她选择进入大公司实习，一步一步慢慢往上爬。男友却选择做传销行业，相信自己会成为那个幸运儿，赚到大钱。 四年过去，她的收入稳定成长，从四位数变成五位数。男友的收入却一直不稳定。好的时候 RM2,000 至 RM3,000，不好的时候甚至只有 RM100。虽然她不喜欢传销行业，但因为男友热爱，她一直支持。有时候她会帮忙买 RM1,000+ 的产品，也介绍亲戚朋友加入。但是如果有人拒绝，男友就指责她不够用心，说这个行业需要人脉，她必须介绍更多人，他才有收入。 最近他的收入真的不稳定，开始依赖她生活。虽然我们没住在一起，但他的租金是女子一个人承担。这个月男友搬来同住，本以为在一起会更加幸福，却发现生活开销暴涨。两人外出吃一餐就要花 RM100 至 RM200，再加上娱乐、礼物、衣服，甚至 iPhone，多数由她买单。每个月在男友身上的花费至少 RM3000 以上。 男友却说自己负责开车接送，油费很贵。到了月尾，他又向她哭穷，让她还油钱，她也真的给了。 更让她难过的是，男友几乎不做家务。她每天工作到很晚，回家还要收拾残局。 她开始怀疑，这段感情到底是爱，还是负担？她给他吃穿用度，还被男友 PUA 说她 「回家休息不赚钱就是错！」 贴文一出，引起不少网民热议。有人心疼她的付出，也有人劝她认真思考，这段感情是否真的值得继续。 ▼ 分！ ▼ 把钱花在自己身上更好 感情本来就是两个人一起努力，如果只剩一个人在撑，这样还能走下去吗？

                              <span>Hi guys, need some advice.. parents are getting to that age when they want to settle their inheritance issue. Our thought is, rather than splitting up assets and giving this sibling this or that to individually manage, it would be better financially to put everything in a trust or a company and have all sibling manage/share it equally. The basic thinking is that we can do more when we pool our assets all together. From what I’ve read online there are some pros to doing this, protection of assets in case of bankruptcy, and more structured financial planning for future generations..
 I’ve briefly talked to some people (relatives who are in a related field) and so far the initial reaction I get is not to do it because it usually causes rifts in the family but when I dig deeper the cause of that is usually because nobody discusses or agrees to exit terms beforehand.
 So, leaving out family dynamics, just wanted some input on whether it financially makes sense and if so what are technical ways to do this? Very interested to hear from people who’ve actually done something like this. TIA!

                              <span>I have a 40 year old 2-storey terrace house I had inherited. It used to be rented out but had been abandoned for about 20 years.
 The property is in a mature township and can fetch about RM400,000 for similar (non-abandoned) units. 
 The house is paid off already, so other than taxes, it doesn’t require any maintenance (other than reimbursing my neighbour for fixes affecting them or cutting the grass) . I’ve received offers around RM250,000 pre-COVID but held on to it hoping for something nearer to RM300,000. I presume the new buyer will spend minimum 100k to refurbish the unit. 
 Just want to rule out keeping the property. I have other homes and have a mortgage on my current own stay. Rental isn’t an option as I don’t want to spend any money fixing the house.
 Questions:
  
How is RPGT calculated? 
  
- S&amp;P was done 40 years 
 - Deceased 20 years ago
 - My name on grant by land office only done last year
  
How much agent fees should I expect? 2% of transacted price? 
 
I have bought subsale before and presume legal expenses bourne by purchaser. Is this correct? Do I incur any legal fees as a seller?
 
Any other tips?

Peru’s congress has elected José María Balcázar, an octogenarian leftist lawmaker who has defended child marriage, as the country’s interim president ahead of general elections in April.
Balcázar is Peru’s ninth president since 2016. The surprise election, in which Balcázar beat the favourite, María del Carmen Alva, a conservative, came after lawmakers voted to remove José Jerí as president on Tuesday after just four months in office, due to a scandal over secretive meetings with Chinese businessmen.

More than 1,000 Kenyans have been lured to fight for Russia in its war with Ukraine, according to an intelligence report to the Kenyan parliament that highlights the scale of a Russian operation taking African men to the frontline.
The majority leader of Kenya’s national assembly, Kimani Ichung’wah, said “rogue recruitment agencies and individuals in Kenya” were continuing to send Kenyan nationals to fight in the conflict, as he read MPs the summary of an investigation by Kenya’s National Intelligence Service.

The former chancellor George Osborne has said countries that do not embrace the kind of powerful AI systems made by his new employer, OpenAI, risk “Fomo” and could be left weaker and poorer.
Osborne, who is two months into a job as head of the $500bn San Francisco AI company’s “for countries” programme, told leaders gathered for the AI Impact summit in Delhi: “Don’t be left behind.” He said that without AI rollouts they could end up with a workforce “less willing to stay put” because they might want to seek AI-enabled fortunes elsewhere.

 AVUV 10%
 AVDV AVES 5% each
 May I seek some advice as to how the allocation would be different for Malaysians? Thanks in advance

                              <span>Happy CNY / holidays guys!
 29M data analyst here. I’ve been in retail for about 4 years (2 companies). With retail volatility lately, company performance has been quite affected. I recently received a contract offer from a major insurance company in KL. +23% from my current permanent role, with 2 days WFH.
 The downside as you know is that it’s a contract role, so there’s always the uncertainty of renewal/absorption. That said, since it’s a big player in the industry, I’m quite tempted to give it a try.
 Wondering what people think about insurance industry as a whole? I&#x27;ve heard some say with premium prices going up, people might stop paying insurance. 
 The industry is totally new to me so any thoughts is appreciated.

                              <span>Currently I&#x27;m working in medical sales. These are my stats:
  
Base: RM5,900 /month
 (Fixed) Travel Allowance: RM1,000 /month
 (Fixed) Misc Allowance: RM400 /month
  
In your experience, do new employers usually consider your base salary or overall total salary when offering a salary package? Ie. Will they base an offer based on RM5,900 or my total salary RM7,300. As I might pivot to a non-sales role, so the transport allowance given might not be as high. Thanks for any input!

                              <span>Currently working in a tech role. My options are as follows below:
 Company A (current company)
  
RM8.5K / month (including allowance)
 4 days WFH, 1 day WFO
 1-3 months bonus
 3-4 % annual increment
 21 days AL
  
Company B (new company)
  
RM11.5K / month (matched by asking salary)
 4 days WFO, 1 day WFH
 1 month bonus (on average)
 ? % annual increment (expecting it to be 2-3%)
 14 days AL
  
I truly value work life balance so my current role is perfect plus the culture and work is fulfilling. I also have a side business that generates roughly RM2-3K / month which may be impacted if I work almost fully in office.
 That said, I acknowledge that company B offers growth in terms of salary progression. What are your thoughts?
 Additional Note:
  
The side business is not very scalable.
 Company B&#x27;s culture seems like a cinaman company, small startup with all guys who tend to communicate in Mandarin (noticed this while waiting for interview), I don&#x27;t speak Mandarin... Plus you&#x27;re expected to stay until 7PM but can come in around 10AM+
 Highly unlikely to get a counteroffer by A as I&#x27;ve already been promoted

                              <span>Long story short, I will be reimbursed for some insurance claim via a physical cheque which will be sent to a relative’s place in the US. The payee name on the check is my name, I am currently living in Malaysia. What’s the easiest and most efficient way for me to cash out this cheque? 
 I understand that wise’s US bank account cannot receive cheque deposits. We are currently considering for me to endorse the cheque to allow 3rd party deposit&gt;relative deposits and receives the cash &gt;transfers to me
 Anyone dealt with the similar experience before ? 
 Thanks

 What about locations with the inverse - used to be thriving with an abundant population / demand which has died out and why?

                              <span>农历新年，本该热热闹闹、讨个好意头的一刻，结果却变成网络上的争议焦点。 根据「8 视界新闻网」报道，新加坡一家知名房地产媒体科技公司日前举办员工聚餐，并在社交媒体上传庆祝视频。原本是公司内部的团拜画面，却因为「捞鱼生」环节的举动，引发大量网民炮轰。 视频中可见，员工在进行捞生活动时，并非象征性地「越捞越旺」，而是直接把鱼生当成「道具」抛来抛去。有员工用筷子夹起鱼生丢向同事，其中一桌甚至把整盘鱼生打翻在地。更夸张的是，还有人直接用手抓起桌上的鱼生往外抛，现场一度混乱。 有人甚至在头上套上透明塑料袋，相信是为了避免被乱飞的鱼生「击中」。画面曝光后，不少人直呼离谱。 公司在帖文中写道，庆祝活动在过年活动、创意表演以及「有意义的捞鱼生」中达到高潮。然而，视频释出后却迅速在网络发酵。 该视频在 Facebook 累计接近 5 万次观看，在 Instagram 也突破 2 万次观看。随后，公司已将视频限制留言功能。不过，相关画面已被网友截图和转发到各大社交平台，引发更大讨论。 不少网民留言批评员工行为「幼稚」、「低级」，也有人直言「食物是拿来吃的，不是拿来玩的」还有人指出，捞鱼生本是寓意吉祥，这样浪费食物，实在不妥。 值得一提的是，早前新加坡南洋理工大学宿舍学生，也曾因在捞鱼生活动中乱丢食材的视频引起热议。当时校方表示会对涉事学生进行辅导。 一场原本喜庆的团拜活动，因为处理不当，最终变成争议风波。新年讨好意头没错，但分寸拿捏，或许更重要。 来源：8视界新闻网

When the Canadian Kimberly Prost learned Donald Trump’s administration had imposed sanctions on her, it came as a shock.
For years, she has sat as a judge at the international criminal court, weighing accusations of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity; now she is on the same list as terrorists and those involved in organised crime. “It really was a moment of a bit of disbelief,” she said.

Silicon Valley tech billionaires will land in Delhi this week for an AI summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, where leaders of the global south will wrestle for control over the fast-developing technology.
During the week-long AI Impact Summit, attended by thousands of tech executives, government officials and AI safety experts, tech companies valued at trillions of dollars will rub along with leaders of countries such as Kenya and Indonesia, where average wages dip well below $1,000 a month.

US military officials have said American forces launched assaults on three alleged drug-smuggling boats, killing 11 in one of the deadliest days of the Trump administration’s months-long campaign against alleged traffickers.
The military action on Monday brought the number of fatalities caused by US strikes to 145 since September, when Donald Trump called on American armed forces to attack people deemed “narco-terrorists” on small vessels. There have been 42 known strikes in notorious drug-trafficking routes such as the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, according to the Associated Press reported.

                              <span>I (M27) recently received a couple of assets from my father. One is a plot of land around 1.5 acres, valued at RM300k. Another one is a brand new single storey terrace house on a corner lot. Both are Malay reserve land.
 The thing is that these assets are in Perak while I live in East Malaysia. I don’t know what to do with the house aside from renting them. As for the land, it is already encroached by my relatives whom I barely know. Any advice?
 Edit: East Malaysia 😅, Somewhere rural in Sabah

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am quite financial illiterate (or investment illiterate), and i want to start with investing. Currently i already have quite some money in asb, and like to start in either
  
Gold
 
Stocks (s&amp;p 500 etc)
 
Crypto
 
 Previously i have dipped my legs in trading crypto, and when btc and eth boom last year, i sold everything (due to in need of money) and get quite a profit. But looking at crypto dip so bad rn, makes me a bit scared. Im not looking to put a lot in one of these three, probably around rm200-rm500 monthly.
 Any advice from the professionals?

Bangladesh’s new prime minister has been sworn in, sealing a dramatic comeback for the Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP) and formally closing the turbulent chapter that toppled Sheikh Hasina in 2024.
The swearing-in of Tarique Rahman restored an elected government after 18 months of caretaker rule led by the Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus.

When Boniface Mwangi, the prominent Kenyan pro-democracy activist who plans to run for president in 2027, had his phones returned to him by Kenyan authorities after his controversial arrest last July, he immediately noticed a problem: one of the phones was no longer password protected and could be opened without one.
It was Mwangi’s personal phone, which he used to communicate with friends and mentors, and contained photos of private family moments with his wife and children. Knowing that its contents could be in the hands of the Kenyan government made Mwangi – who has described harassment and even torture – feel unsafe and “exposed”, he told the Guardian.

                              <span>The next crash is from crypto Bitcoin. Reason is 
 You cannot buy anything with it. Many just pay and hard to get money out. 
 It is based on a small number of believers on imaginary value. 
 The derivatives is also a form of imaginary value.
 The crash is when the major holder off load . Left the bag carriers and their false hope . The reality come when margin calls . So much it actually sucks in the financial institutions.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m going to be getting my first salary in a couple of days, and I&#x27;m super excited! My job only lasted 3 weeks since they&#x27;re planning on doing renovation during Ramadan, and I&#x27;m not planning to continue as I&#x27;m going to be busy after getting my spm results, most likely. But that&#x27;s besides the point. 
 I&#x27;d like to know how to spend my first salary? I&#x27;m planning to save up 80% (since I don&#x27;t really have any necessities to spend on now anyway), but I&#x27;ve also thought of investing– buying gold, or investing on amanah saham. I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s best to start as early as I can, but I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;d love to know what you guys think! :)

                              <span>讲到结婚，很多情侣都会面对现实两个字——钱。 近日，大马一名男子在 Facebook「B神 BGod」匿名发文表示，自己今年 33 岁，月薪 RM3000+。虽然收入不算高，但他一直努力工作，也认真为未来打算。 他和女朋友交往多年。女友常说一句话： 「没有屋子，不要结婚。结婚一定要有自己的家。」 他其实认同。以现在马来西亚的房价来说，租屋确实让人没有安全感。所以这两年里，他开始拼命存钱，减少出门娱乐，少和朋友聚会，能省就省，只希望早一点存够首期。 可是，问题慢慢出现了。 女友一边说要存钱买屋子，一边却喜欢买名牌包、换新手机，还要求他带她去网红餐厅打卡拍照。她常说：「现在不享受，等几时？」在她看来，女生爱美很正常，而男朋友愿意花钱，是一种疼爱。 一开始，他也觉得偶尔宠一下没关系。但后来，情况变了。iPhone 是他刷卡，旅行是他刷卡，生日礼物是他刷卡。甚至有时候她说：「你帮我签一下先，下个月我给你。」结果分期付款却落在他的名下。 久而久之，他身上多了一笔信用卡债务，而那是为了她而签下的。 当他提起压力，说自己很辛苦时，女友却反过来说他不够上进。她说，如果真的想娶她，就应该更努力赚钱，而不是一直讲压力。 他开始矛盾，觉得男人多承担一点，好像是理所当然。但是，他不明白，如果目标是买屋结婚，为什么生活方式却一直在消耗？他说，现在自己越来越害怕提到「钱」这个字。因为只要一谈钱，女友就觉得他计较。 这篇贴文引起不少网民热议 ▼ 分！ ▼ 把人家当 ATM？ ▼ 够力！这名男子最后问道：「在马来西亚，如果一个女生坚持要有屋子才结婚，却同时不断增加开销，到底是男生能力不够，还是这段关系一开始就出是错的？」

                              <span>新年要扮美美，不少人都会提前做好「变美三宝」，像是做美发、护肤、美甲等。然而，在追求精致外观的背后，可能隐藏着你意想不到的受伤风险。 中国杭州一名 22 岁女子日前做了一款心仪已久的美甲，没想到在隔天骑电动摩托时发生意外，导致指甲连同甲床断裂，甚至引发指骨骨折。 根据《新民晚报》报道，王姓女子为了让手指看起来更修长，还特意贴了延长甲片。不料，她隔天骑车时却不慎摔倒，手掌本能撑地，结果导致左手食指上的延长甲片连同甲床直接断裂流血。她随即前往杭州市临平区中西医结合医院骨科就诊。 经检查发现，王女左手食指出现指骨骨折、甲床破裂，部分甲床外露，必须通过手术修复。院方为她进行指骨骨折闭合复位内固定手术，目前术后恢复情况良好。 接诊的曹立副主任医师指出，如果没有这么细长复杂的美甲，伤势也许不会这么严重。其延长甲片会增加手指的受力面积和杠杆作用，一旦摔倒，很容易产生撬动效应，导致指甲撕脱、甲床损伤，甚至引发骨折。 曹医师也表示，虽然王女情况属于极端个例，但美甲确实会影响手部正常活动，而且指甲造型越复杂，影响就越明显。频繁做美甲或做不当美甲，存在不少健康隐患。 例如，打磨甲面容易让甲层变薄易断；美甲环境不卫生，可能引发指甲真菌感染；频繁去死皮、使用卸甲水或甲油胶等，可能增加过敏性皮肤病或感染性皮肤病等疾病风险；若美甲油质量不佳，还可能诱发呼吸疾病。 此外，曹医师还提醒指甲的生长周期一般为 3 个月，因此两次美甲最好间隔 3 个月以上，且不建议选择过于复杂或者带有突出装饰的款式。 美甲不是不能做，是要适度，别让一时爱美换来受伤和健康代价。

                              <span>NOTE: We have to step away for a bit but we’ll try to come back and answer more. Thanks again for your questions.
 As we watch the surveillance dystopia unfold across Trump&#x27;s America, we&#x27;ve spent over a year reporting on the technologies used by ICE, DHS, and other local law enforcement to actively surveil, target and detain citizens and immigrants alike.
 Recently, we uncovered the tool Palantir is making for ICE to find neighborhoods to raid, how local police unmasked millions of surveillance targets because of Flock redaction error and how DHS is lying about killing people in Minneapolis.
 Ask us anything on February 4 at 12 pm ET about the state of surveillance in America. Get your questions in now.
