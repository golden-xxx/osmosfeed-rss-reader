I am very lucky that I live with my parents and no need to pay for rent. Mom is a stay at home housewife so she usually cooks me lunch for me to bawak bekal to office. Same goes for dinner, as she cooks for the whole family.\n I am also naturally frugal and dont spend much on clothes or outing. No financial commitment as well. No girlfriend, car, or any student loan. I also commute to work by public transport everyday. So technically I only spend about RM200 out of my pocket every month for Netflix, PS+, late night kopitiam etc. This means I save RM4k/month on the regular after deducting all my expenses.\n My dad takes home about RM10k per month, with a fully paid hous…",

Our thought is, rather than splitting up assets and giving this sibling this or that to individually manage, it would be better financially to put everything in a trust or a company and have all sibling manage/share it equally. The basic thinking is that we can do more when we pool our assets all together. From what I’ve read online there are some pros to doing this, protection of assets in case of bankruptcy, and more structured financial planning for future generations..\n I’ve briefly talked to some people (relatives who are in a related field) and so far the initial reaction I get is not to do it because it usually causes rifts in the family but when I dig deeper the cause of that is usually because nobody discusses or agrees to exit terms beforehand.\n So, leaving out family dynamics, just wanted some input on whether it financially makes sense and if so what are technical ways to do this?

          "description": "Happy CNY / holidays guys!\n 29M data analyst here. I’ve been in retail for about 4 years (2 companies). With retail volatility lately, company performance has been quite affected. I recently received a contract offer from a major insurance company in KL. +23% from my current permanent role, with 2 days WFH.\n The downside as you know is that it’s a contract role, so there’s always the uncertainty of renewal/absorption. That said, since it’s a big player in the industry, I’m quite tempted to give it a try.\n Wondering what people think about insurance industry as a whole? I've heard some say with premium prices going up, people might stop paying insurance. \n The industry is totally new to me so any thoughts is appreciated. \n    submitted by    /u/Yenrusu  \n [link]   [comments]",

These are my stats:\n  \nBase: RM5,900 /month\n (Fixed) Travel Allowance: RM1,000 /month\n (Fixed) Misc Allowance: RM400 /month\n  \nIn your experience, do new employers usually consider your base salary or overall total salary when offering a salary package?

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I’m from Sarawak, and I would like to respectfully seek guidance regarding a family heirloom . It is an old Iban Kain Kumbu textile that has been passed down through approximately 4–5 generations in my family.... l am not sure but would like to ask an expert about this!!\n Family lineage timeline:\n • My late great-great grandmother • Passed down to my late great grandmother • Then to my grandmother • Then to my mother • Now in my possession \n According to my mother’s oral history, this textile was worn by an ancestor named Niang Inik Kantan. The longhouse origin is unfortunately unknown as most elders in our family have passed away sadly no information was to further explaining more about this Kain Kumbu\n The piece appears:\n • Handwoven • Naturally dyed (earth tones, deep browns, muted red/blue) • Smaller in size compared to modern 1970s–1990s Kain Kumbu • In good structural condition • Has a natural woody scent consistent with aged textile storage \n I am genuinely seeking:\n 1. Advice on authentication. 2. How to verify age (pre-1900? 1800s?). 3. Whether museum textile experts in Sarawak or Malaysia would be appropriate to consult. 4. General historical context of early Kain Kumbu weaving. \n I deeply respect its cultural and spiritual value, and I want to approach this carefully and correctly. Because this is from our family heirloom and been on generations...\n Any guidance from historians, textile experts, collectors, or museum professionals would be sincerely appreciated.\n Thank you.\n Comparison size to the modern one on second photo..\n    submitted by    /u/Future_Discipline184  \n [link]   [comments]",

Got nailed by taxes pretty hard ($6k), and I'm looking at how to plan moving forward outside of memorizing the tax code for my state lol.\n My original plan was to set up a sinking fund to cover moving out expenses (10%) and put 15% into the Rath. However that plan needs to be put on pause for obvious reasons. Now I could dip into my efund and simply adjust said plan, with the 15% going into rebuilding it and the 10% going into the IRA, but while these taxes are definitely scary, I think I can pay them off with monthly payments and by filing an extension. I had no issues paying them off last year, so I don't have a negative reputation with the IRS. That and the last thing I need is to pay off taxes only for an actual emergency to happen.\n What do yall think? Is this a sound approach to dealing with these expenses? Would you deem taxes a suitable emergency? Should I drop everything (including the Rath) to pay these off (Baby Step 2)? Would love your feedback.\n If I don't respond immediately, I'm on the way home. Thanks everyone!\n    submitted by    /u/TotalLeeAwesome  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I know the topic of including international stocks has come up a few times this week, but I finally made the change. A few years ago I read The Simple Path to Wealth and started following it's principles, not perfectly, but as well as I could in my situation with a young family. I have been watching VXUS over the past year due to seeing an interview with J.L. where he mentioned that he would tell his daughter to watch out for international stocks starting to outperform U.S. stocks due to changes in the global economy. When I saw his blog post this month, I decided to include international stocks as well and I intend to be invested in them long term. \n I saw another post here that recommended moving all stocks to VT for it's simplicity and just let it ride. However, isn't cost also a major factor? I wanted to keep an eye on costs and implement this in the most cost effective way possible. What I did is take a portion from VTI and move it to VXUS, which will give me a better expense ratio and have very similar performance as just holding VT. VT has an expense ratio of .06%, VXUS is .05%, and VTI is .03%. So, for example, if I have a total of $10,000 invested with approximately $6,000 in VTI and $4,000 (about 60% U.S. and 40% international) I'm only paying .03% for the bulk of my stock portfolio and .05% for the international component instead of .06% to hold everything in one fund. It's easy for me to rebalance to keep about the same ratios as VT as well because I add to the fund throughout the year and can add a little more to VTI or more to VXUS to keep in line with VT. What are some of the arguments against this approach? Is it just for simplicity and not tinkering with your investments?\n    submitted by    /u/RandomThings365  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently have $165k of student loans left (was $208k in 2023 between PA school and undergrad, so about ~40k paid off in 3 years), highest interest rate is 6.5%. I have $58,495 in my 401k where I have a 6% employer match and just increased my contribution from 10% to 15% to get close to maxing it out.

One is my main card which I typically put 3-5k on every month and then pay it off in full on time every month.\n The others I use for subscriptions and odd purchases here and there, probably a total of about $600 across those cards.\n My total utilization never passes 10%. I applied for a new card because my main one is pretty barebones and doesnt offer many rewards. I found one that has decent rewards for travel and dining, so I applied.\n Credit score: 798\n Total unused credit: 72k\n Current balance across all cards: $3200\n Gross Annual income (combined with wife): 312k\n I got approved and they extended me a $5.1k credit line. This is far lower than my current card. Im just confused about why it would be so low.\n I spoke with a coworker and he said its probably because credit companies want me to carry a balance and they dont want someone who pays it off in full every month.

          "description": "I've spent a few hours trying to wrap my head around why people online (see here) are often adamant that a traditional 401(k) and Roth IRA is the way to go - especially with how high the praise is for the latter - yet I don't often see people talking about doing both a Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA. If the Roth IRA is so great, why wouldn't you want to also do a Roth 401(k)? It seems like they adhere to the same taxation rules, so is there something substantially different about Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA accounts that make them fundamentally different animals that I'm just not aware of? Maybe it's simply for diversification? The only real difference I've heard is that Roth IRAs typically allow for more aggressive investment options and the ability to withdraw contributions easier, but that's about it.\n My job allows me to contribute to a traditional and/or Roth 401(k) with a match up to 4% - my understanding is if I were to switch to a Roth percentage, their match would still go to a traditional, pre-tax account instead - and I'm currently maxing it out on the traditional side while maxing a separate Roth IRA. I'm not uncomfortable with that arrangement, but it still irks me not understanding what makes a Roth 401(k) \"bad\" but a Roth IRA \"good\" in the eyes of a lot of people (I know it's largely subjective and relative to individuals' goals, but you know what I mean), when they're like... the same thing as far as I can tell.\n Thanks in advance for any information.\n    submitted by    /u/spongebobstyle  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Don't get an expensive master's degree unless you truly need it for career advancement (i.e., you have a very concrete and realistic plan of how you will pay for it). \n I am a teacher at a private boarding school in Massachusetts. A lot of my colleagues found themselves in the workforce for a few years, usually as teachers, then decided that their life felt stagnant and got a master's degree from places like Columbia or whatever. They figured it was a logical next move as a typical \"striver\" who wants to achieve the next milestone in life, assuming it would lead to new opportunities. Underrated fact: even at places like Harvard, many of these master's degrees are not particularly selective and will enroll almost any baseline smart/competent person - they're a cash cow for the university primarily used to fund their PhD programs! \n Anyways, these people end up in serious debt and forego earnings while getting the degrees, sometimes in excess of $100,000. And what did they do with their degree? They went back to teaching - basically the exact same job they already had with the same earning potential. \n I'm curious if this is a pattern in other lines of work - do any of your coworkers also randomly get masters degree at enormous expense that they don't put to good use? In my opinion you should only go to graduate school for a profession that truly requires the credential (JD, MD, etc), or if you get it funded (via a PhD program or through your employer).\n    submitted by    /u/NotAGoldenRetriever  \n [link]   [comments]",
