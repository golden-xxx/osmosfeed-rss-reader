          "description": "这样的街头美食价格，你能接受吗？ 近日，一名走「高端定价」路线的本地网红摊主因新品售价问题，在社交平台掀起热议。她日前在鹅唛一场美食节活动中推出新品 —— 芝士东炎春卷，并透过 TikTok 大力宣传。 她介绍，这款特大春卷， 3 条售价为 RM18.90 (含 SST)。每条内馅配有蘑菇、沙葛及莫扎里拉芝士，顾客也可选择鸡肉或牛肉口味。春卷外层还撒上帕玛森芝士碎，并配以香菜点缀，结合浓厚芝士风味与东炎特色。 不料，价格一公开，立即出现两极化反应。不少人认为仅 3 条就卖这么贵，根本不值得！ 事实上，这并非该摊主第一次因定价问题成为话题。早前，她售卖的黄姜饭，一盒 RM37.10，同样曾被指价格偏贵，甚至有网民扬言要杯葛。 面对外界的批评，该摊主也作出回应，解释背后的定价考量。她表示，顾客所支付的价格与所获得的价值是相符的。无论是原材料的选择、制作过程，还是最后呈现给顾客的成品，团队都把品质和口味放在首位。 同时，她也强调每一道料理都经过用心准备，确保新鲜与高水准，让顾客每次光顾都能享有满意且优质的用餐体验。高价策略是为了应付员工薪资及税务成本，因此坚持走精品化经营路线。 至于这样的定价是否合理，或许就见仁见智。你是否愿意为这样的创意料理买单吗？ ▼ 完整视频： @daniasedek Lumpia ni LIMITED tau kome ada kat Tour je tau,so warga Gombak jangan lepaskan peluang dapatkan Lumpia Ayam&Daging Kami tinggal 2 Hari lagi harini (31 Jan 2026) dan esok (01 Feb) dekat […]\nThe post 3条春卷含SST卖RM18.90被嫌贵！摊主回应：对得起这个价！ appeared first on Moretify.",

          "description": "property agent 常被视为「低门槛、高回报」的造梦工厂。闪亮的名车、丰厚的佣金、草根逆袭的故事，吸引着无数年轻人前赴后继。然而，当梦想撞上行业的灰色地带，一位入行仅三个月的网友，正经历着职业生涯中最沉重的价值拷问。 近日，一名从事 property agent 的网友匿名投稿称自己学历不高，但对房地产怀有极大的热忱。三个月前，他怀揣着「靠努力改变命运」的决心，加入了一家业绩亮眼的销售公司。 入职初期，网友的生活被无尽的电话销售、客户邀约和旧名单跟进填满。团队的高压氛围让他深信，「努力」与「速度」是通往成功的唯二密钥。然而，随着业务深入，一些细节开始让他感到不安。 网友举个例子，一个项目的官方月供显示为 RM2,200，但在公司的宣传册上，却变成了RM1,300。然而这样做的背后，是为了让顾客觉得负担更轻。这也让网友怀疑「这真的是专业的做法吗？」 比数字调整更让网友困惑的，是对未来的描述。他继续表示，当项目周边目前缺乏基础设施，如商店、高速公路时，公司的话术并非缄口不言，而是教导他们使用「未来会有」、「这是 proposed 的」、「政府规划中，一定会发展起来」等引导性语言。 虽然从字面上看，没有直接撒谎，项目确实在规划中。但看着客户满怀期待的眼神，网友心里有个声音在问：「几年后他们收楼，面对依然荒凉的周边，还会记得今天那个信誓旦旦的我吗？」作为一个资历尚浅的新人，网友起初只能照做。但当他陆续签下几单成交后，预期的喜悦并未降临，取而代之的是辗转反侧的夜晚。 我躺在床上一直在想：我真的做对了吗？我是在帮顾客找到家，还是在帮自己说服自己接受一套并不完全认同的价值观？ 在房产交易这个高度依赖信任的行业里，「包装」与「欺诈」的界限往往模糊不清。高额佣金驱动下的业绩压力，时常让年轻从业者在职业操守与现实利益之间艰难摇摆。对此，你们怎么看？\nThe post 成为top sales全靠tam顾客！大马房产新人几个月成交了几单却每晚睡不着！ appeared first on Moretify.",

          "description": "中国江西九江一名 00 后大学毕业生张瑾，以每月 200 元（约 113 令吉）租住养老院单间，并持续当志愿服务两年多，在网络引发关注。 综合媒体报导，张瑾于 2023 前往苏州工作，一次偶然刷手机时看到一则养老院招募志愿者的推文，内容写道：「年轻人为老人提供陪伴、娱乐、教学，就能以 200、300 元的月租入住养老院」。当时面临房租压力和独居的孤独感，加上养老院距离公司不远，便抱着试一试的心态报名，没想到一住，就爱上这里的生活。 张瑾周一至周五照常到公司上班，到了周末会在养老院当志工。她目前住在一个二十多平米的单间里，房间以原木风为主调，布置温馨舒适。她透露，在苏州正常租住普通房间，每月租金约 2000 元（约 1129 令吉），几乎占自己收入的一半。过去租房还需要父母补贴一点生活费，如今住进养老院后，房租压力大幅减轻。 她坦言，选择入住的原因之一是可享房租减免政策，另一个原因则是觉得很新颖、很好奇。自己刚到苏州时没有太多亲友，在养老院的生活不仅丰富了业余时间，也让她感受到亲人般的温暖，比职场更治愈人心。 据了解，该养老院的招聘条件，要求志愿者年龄必须在 35 岁以下、在苏州没有房子，并具备一定特长或爱好。当时共有 40-50 人报名，最终录取了 5 人。其志愿服务内容，主打一个倾听、一个陪伴，给老人家们提供情绪价值。 张瑾每个季度需完成 45 小时，每周平均不到 4 小时的志愿服务，内容包括陪老人聊天、组织活动、教手指舞和参与文娱互动等。完成规定时数后，可持续享 200 元月租。 她表示，与老人相处的氛围简单但真诚。在公司付出未必能获得肯定，但与老人们相处，无论做什么事，他们都会夸赞或表达感谢，从中收获的情感回馈远超过房租优惠。老人们的关心和陪伴，让她在异乡不再孤单，这种温暖是金钱买不到的。通过与长者相处，也让她学到了很多人生道理，变得更加成熟和坚强。 如今两年多过去，当初同时入选的几名年轻人因婚恋或工作变动陆续搬离，目前仅剩她一人继续居住。张瑾现在仍一边上班，一边从事志愿服务，暂无搬离打算，以后会根据未来职业和生活安排再作决定。\nThe post 比职场更治愈人心！00后女生月租RM113住养老院两年，收获亲人般的温暖！ appeared first on Moretify.",

          "description": "在马来西亚，舞狮不仅是节庆表演，更是一种陪伴我们长大的文化记忆。无论是新年开工、开张志庆，还是庙会巡游，总能看到醒狮队伍浩浩荡荡出发。而许多舞狮团平日出队时，都会乘坐罗里「lori」前往表演地点，这样的画面，对不少人来说早已司空见惯。 不过，近期一名网友却在 Facebook 发文诉苦被警察开 Saman！ 贴主：出了几十年的队，第一次给警察开saman，第一次听到出队的罗里不能载人。狮友们大家注意你们罗里，不能载人啊！我现在已经中了。 语气中满是无奈与愤怒，还提醒其他「狮友」要特别注意！帖文一出，很快引起关注。不少网民在评论区留言讨论，相关贴文的留言区几乎一面倒，认为无论是否为了舞狮出队，罗里本就不应该载人。有人指出，交通条例早有规定，货车或罗里属于载货用途车辆，若后方车斗并未设有合法座位与安全装置，载人本身就存在安全隐患。 也有网民理性表示，理解舞狮团体出队时为了方便，会选择集体乘坐同一辆 lori 前往表演场地，但若发生意外，后果不堪设想。「平时没事不代表合法」、「一旦紧急刹车或发生碰撞，车斗上的人是最危险的」，类似的留言不断出现。 或许这是长期以来的「行业习惯」。尤其是在一些社区或乡镇地区，舞狮团经费有限，租用巴士或安排多辆私家车接送，成本相对更高。使用 lori 载人，往往是为了节省开销与方便搬运器材，一车同时载狮头、鼓、旗帜及队员，看似效率更高。 不过，从法律与安全角度来看，不少网民仍强调，文化传承固然重要，但不应建立在违规或危险之上。也有人建议，相关单位或协会或许可以加强宣导，让舞狮团体更清楚交通规则，同时探讨是否有更安全的替代方案。 ▼ 双方都中？！ ▼ 看运气？ ▼ 原来如此 ▼ 经济路线 ▼ Opps ▼ 还能十个人？ ▼ erm... ▼ 看门就对了？ 舞狮作为马来西亚多元文化的一部分，一直深受社会重视。每逢佳节，醒狮高桩腾跃的画面，早已成为街头最热闹的风景。然而，这起事件也让不少人开始反思，在传承文化的同时，是否也需要与时并进，兼顾安全与合规。 目前，当事网友并未透露罚款金额，但其贴文已成功提醒不少「狮友」提高警惕。文化需要被珍惜，安全同样不能忽视。对此，你怎么看呢？ 来源：Facebook/Leo Lai\nThe post 出了几十年队第一次中SAMAN！舞狮罗里载人被开罚单引发热议！ appeared first on Moretify.",

The country lies in the centre of tensions between the US and Iran and is directly vulnerable to maritime instability and regional escalation.\nIf the talks fail, there is uncertainty over what the US may do regarding a possible military attack against Iran, and when it might act. Questions remain over what this could mean for the wider region, with Iran warning it would retaliate and even attack Israel.\nThe state-run Oman News Agency has posted photos on social media showing the Omani foreign minister Badr Albusaidi sat with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Geneva.\n Continue reading...",

The Soviets marched from the gates of Leningrad to Berlin in a little over 15 months in 1944-45; today the Russian rate of gain in Pokrovsk in Ukraine is 70 metres a day, in Kupiansk, 23 metres, according to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.\nThe gains are trivial, given Ukraine’s size, amounting to 1,865 sq miles during 2025 (about 0.8% of the country) – so the idea touted by the Russians, sometimes accepted by a credulous White House, that Ukraine is suffering a slow-motion defeat, is not accurate. In reality, even allowing for the fact that hundreds of thousands of homes are without electricity, heating and water after Russian bombing, Ukraine is clarifying its strategy and pushing back with modest success.\n Continue reading...",

On one side is a Christian nationalist stream of the Maga movement, which views the United States’s close relationship with Israel with increasing suspicion. On the other is an older Christian conservative establishment that views that alliance as a totem of US foreign policy – and in some cases believes that Israeli Jews possess a divine right to a large swathe of the Middle East, US public opinion be damned.\n Continue reading...",

We’re now considering buying a landed home for own stay, price around RM930k to 1m.\n Plan is:\n • New landed under the other partner’s single name (lower income)\n • 35-year loan\n • Instalment estimated around low RM4k range\n • No other major commitments, no kids. Our average monthly expenses are about RM9k.\n Main concerns:\n • Is this too aggressive for our income level?\n • Would you wait longer before committing to a landed at this price?\n Appreciate any real life experiences, especially from those juggling mortgage + rental at the same time.\n Thanks in advance.\n TLDR:\n Early 30s couple, RM16k combined net income, holding 1 condo, considering RM930k landed under single name.

The scholarship covers:\n Full tuition\n On-campus accommodation\n Free campus Wi-Fi\n RM 400 monthly allowance\n Her family is low income. Realistically, her mother can only send an additional USD 100–150 per month.\n So in total, she would have roughly RM 830–1,050 per month for food, transport, phone, personal expenses, etc. (since accommodation and internet are covered).\n But we are worried about:\n Is this amount realistically enough in Alor Setar?\n What do students there actually spend monthly (without rent)?\n Are there hidden costs we should expect?\n How expensive is food near AIU?\n Is RM 800-1,000/month manageable or extremely stressful?\n This is a huge opportunity for her to leave Yemen and study abroad, so we don’t want her to reject it because of fear but we also don’t want her to struggle badly financially.\n If you’ve studied in Alor Setar (or Kedah), especially as an international student, could you share your real monthly spending and whether this budget is feasible?\n Thank you so much.

          "description": "I’m 39F. My take-home pay is around RM8.3k, plus RM2k rental income from a property I own.\n Right now I’m staying with my parents. My mortgage + maintenance for my property is about RM3.5k/month. Even after rental, I still top up RM1.5k monthly for a house I don’t live in.\n When I bought the place years ago, I was earning significantly more. I took a 25-year loan because it made sense then. Since then, I’ve had a career change and my income is lower. I don’t regret the change, but financially it’s tighter.\n Here’s what’s weighing on me:\n •I can’t sell the property without taking a loss.\n •If I move into it after the tenant’s lease ends, I’ll be paying RM3.5k out of RM8.3k (~42% of my income) just for mortgage + maintenance. That doesn’t include utilities, furnishing, minor renovations, or general living costs.\n Technically, I can afford it. But it would feel tight. I wouldn’t have much buffer for saving or investing, and that makes me uneasy.\n At the same time, I’m 39 and still living with my parents. They’re not forcing me out, and we’re on good terms. But emotionally, I feel… stalled. I want my own space. I want autonomy. I want to feel like I’m building my life, not just optimizing spreadsheets.\n To make moving out workable, I’m considering refinancing from 25 years to 30 years to lower the monthly instalment.\n Financially, I know it means paying more interest long term. Emotionally, it might buy me independence and breathing room.\n I guess my real question is: Is it foolish to stretch a loan tenure for lifestyle reasons? Or is this one of those times where optimizing for quality of life is valid?\n Would really appreciate perspectives, especially from anyone who’s navigated property decisions after a career/income shift.\n    submitted by    /u/Atlantis_Peridot  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I see alot of you DCA into it which I think means putting abit abit each month since it's safer incase you invested during a bad time.\n Should I still do this? I'm thinking yes, but what's a good amount and time interval? I've downloaded Fsmone (still waiting for my account to be approved, it's been a week :() and is it safe to put in this much money? \n I don't plan to use this money at all and I can sustain myself with my job so ideally I'd want to put 80+% of the million.\n Thanks in advance\n    submitted by    /u/Pootsonpow123  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also how would capital gains tax work if im regularly buying and selling a stock?\n As far as FX goes, is there a good platform that is safe?

          "description": "Hi guys, need some advice.. parents are getting to that age when they want to settle their inheritance issue. Our thought is, rather than splitting up assets and giving this sibling this or that to individually manage, it would be better financially to put everything in a trust or a company and have all sibling manage/share it equally. The basic thinking is that we can do more when we pool our assets all together. From what I’ve read online there are some pros to doing this, protection of assets in case of bankruptcy, and more structured financial planning for future generations..\n I’ve briefly talked to some people (relatives who are in a related field) and so far the initial reaction I get is not to do it because it usually causes rifts in the family but when I dig deeper the cause of that is usually because nobody discusses or agrees to exit terms beforehand.\n So, leaving out family dynamics, just wanted some input on whether it financially makes sense and if so what are technical ways to do this? Very interested to hear from people who’ve actually done something like this. TIA!\n    submitted by    /u/subaiku  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Serious question, not trying to start drama.\n I understand Ramadan is an important and meaningful month for Muslims here. But I’ve always wondered why the reaction toward people eating in public during fasting hours can sometimes be so intense.\n Malaysia isn’t 100% Muslim, and even among Muslims there are valid reasons not to fast like health issues, menstruation, pregnancy, travel, etc. From the outside, we don’t actually know about people’s situation.\n What confuses me more is that sometimes the response goes beyond just disapproval. There have been cases where people were questioned or detained by religious authorities for eating publicly during Ramadan. That makes it feel like it’s treated almost like as a serious public offense even though the person might simply just be non-Muslim or someone with a valid exemption.\n So, what I’m genuinely trying to understand is why does this issue trigger such strong emotional and institutional reactions?\n Is it about public respect? Community identity? Social pressure? Something else?\n I’m asking because I want to understand the social reasoning behind it, not to attack anyone’s beliefs.\n    submitted by    /u/BankRepulsive8070  \n [link]   [comments]",

Pretty sure not. Apparently for Chinese and Indian cultures single people don't give out money packet during CNY or Thaipusam.\n And I suddenly had a thought.\n Why have I been doing this?

There’s an MRT station being built nearby, plus more hotels and high-rise residences.\n What honestly bothers me isn’t development itself, I understand cities grow. It’s more about how much greenery we’re losing in the process. It used to be a place filled with trees and nature. When I played futsal, I could actually hear birds in the background. Soon, I’ll probably just hear the train passing by.\n Another thing I don’t quite understand is the planning. Companies seems to be launching condo projects everywhere, yet the roads and traffic conditions don’t seem to improve at the same pace. And regarding the new MRT station, we already have two MRT stations about 10–15 minutes away. Wouldn’t it make more sense to improve bus connectivity to those existing stations instead of building another one so close?\n I’m not against progress, but I do wonder if we’re balancing development, infrastructure, and quality of life properly.\n Just sharing some thoughts curious to hear what you guys think.\n    submitted by    /u/GymsharkSingh  \n [link]   [comments]",

My office will be in Bandar Bukit Raja, and I’m considering living in one of these areas:\n • Damansara Heights\n • Mont Kiara\n • Desa ParkCity\n I know Klang Valley traffic can be intense, but I’m trying to understand what a realistic daily commute looks like. I need to be at the office by 8:30 AM.\n When I check Google Maps for public transport, it tells me I’d need to leave 9 hours earlier, which I’m assuming is because it doesn’t know the actual bus/train options for that route. My prefer option would be by car, but I’m not sure if the 40 minutes is realistic\n For those who live in these areas or commute toward Klang/Bukit Raja:\n • How long would the drive take if I leave around 7:45 :\n • Is public transport even a viable option I\n for this route\n • Any tips on the best roads or timing to avoid the worst jams\n Thanks in advance , any local insight would really help me plan!\n    submitted by    /u/Ecstatic-Relative-90  \n [link]   [comments]",

While I'm excited about this new chapter in my life, I am also heartbroken that I need to rehome my cat. I can't take her with me due to the strict pet relocation rules in Australia, and Malaysia is not an approved country for relocating pets. Even if it was, I wouldn't have the financial means to cover the expenses.\n Has anyone here gone through a similar situation? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/Zestyclose_Pool_5604  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I’m from Sarawak, and I would like to respectfully seek guidance regarding a family heirloom . It is an old Iban Kain Kumbu textile that has been passed down through approximately 4–5 generations in my family.... l am not sure but would like to ask an expert about this!!\n Family lineage timeline:\n • My late great-great grandmother • Passed down to my late great grandmother • Then to my grandmother • Then to my mother • Now in my possession \n According to my mother’s oral history, this textile was worn by an ancestor named Niang Inik Kantan. The longhouse origin is unfortunately unknown as most elders in our family have passed away sadly no information was to further explaining more about this Kain Kumbu\n The piece appears:\n • Handwoven • Naturally dyed (earth tones, deep browns, muted red/blue) • Smaller in size compared to modern 1970s–1990s Kain Kumbu • In good structural condition • Has a natural woody scent consistent with aged textile storage \n I am genuinely seeking:\n 1. Advice on authentication. 2. How to verify age (pre-1900? 1800s?). 3. Whether museum textile experts in Sarawak or Malaysia would be appropriate to consult. 4. General historical context of early Kain Kumbu weaving. \n I deeply respect its cultural and spiritual value, and I want to approach this carefully and correctly. Because this is from our family heirloom and been on generations...\n Any guidance from historians, textile experts, collectors, or museum professionals would be sincerely appreciated.\n Thank you.\n Comparison size to the modern one on second photo..\n    submitted by    /u/Future_Discipline184  \n [link]   [comments]",

(keep in mind if i dont do this, ill be force to live w abusive parents)\n is it possible for me to get a fresh grad accounting job in less than a month with just my degree and that supports me (rental and food, i do not own a car or any have any loans)\n lastly, as of rn idk what to do, should i go police and report that my dad tried to kill me by strangling me? im scared if i do, theyll just send me back to my parents. do i stay quiet and try to find a fresh grad job asap and cut contact w them completely?\n  \nany advice would be appreciated\n    submitted by    /u/picklemonster9000  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve been working full-time as a paralegal making $46,000 per year in family law, which is the area I have experience in, and I’ve been saving aggressively while my expenses are low.\n Here’s my rough current financial snapshot:\n $16,200 in savings\n $8,500 in checking\n $8,300 in a Roth IRA\n No debt\n I recently accepted a new paralegal position in family law paying $75,000 per year, which is a $29,000 raise from my current $46k salary. Since it’s the same practice area that I’m already experienced in, it feels like a natural professional step forward just at a significantly higher pay level.\n The major change is that I would be moving out and living on my own in the Chicago suburbs.

She has been on her own for about a year with roomates, but she just doesn't have any credit history because she's young.

We have a good income and plenty of savings so if the worst happens and we have to pay off the lease, it won't ruin us. I don't anticipate needing to apply for any loans myself anytime soon, so if our credit takes a ding it's not the end of the world.\n Knowing the risk of essentially paying my niece's rent if she flakes or something happens, is there any other reason I shouldn't do this?

          "description": "I feel so guilty even thinking about this but my husband has been out of work for 6+ months and the job market is rough. We’ve gone through our savings. I have $20k in credit card debt. We’re working on starting a business that had really tied up our finances even before the job loss, so we’re in a tough spot. I’ve tried to find any other solution and family can’t help. We are at a point where this coming month, we’ll be eating into my limited summer account (the money I put aside to get me through my unpaid summer months as a teacher) and that will only give us about 2 months respite. \n Here’s my dilemma: I started 529 college accounts for my kids that now hold a combined $34k. My kids are 5 and 7. If I withdraw $20k, I can pay off my credit card debt and free up money from those big monthly payments that are largely going to credit card interest. I know I will take a hit on withdrawing it for noneducational reasons, 10% on earnings. It would leave my kids with $8,400 and $5,600 in their college accounts. \n Of course my hope is that our business takes off and I can easily replace this money plus some in the next few years. But if I can’t, I know this withdrawal will greatly diminish what those accounts would be otherwise when they graduate high school. I’m sure college is going to be expensive and I’ve been really proud of being able to sock so much away in these accounts. The idea of withdrawing it makes me feel so guilty but I’m really nervous about our situation right now.\n So, should I withdraw the funds to get rid of high interest debt now, freeing up much needed money each month or grit my teeth and keep looking for any other options? \n    submitted by    /u/Plastic_Post_476  \n [link]   [comments]",

First two were easy to bop off, but the third scheduled Zelle transfer \"wasn't so simple\".

I make decent money, have no debt, and have a great credit score. I’ve been able to max out my IRA and 401 (k) contributions for the past 2 years. I have a 5% down payment saved in addition to emergency savings that will last me about 6 months at my current rent, but probably only 3-4 months if I take on a mortgage. I do not have a partner or family safety net other than my own savings. I wish I had bought 7 years ago, but that ship has sailed.\n In the last few months, with the new AI models and parallel agents, I've hardly written any code. The shift away from relying on my decade software engineering skills into a more supervisory/planning role for AI agents makes me nervous about my professional future. If I were to lose work, I would only have my savings to fall back on until I find another job—no unemployment insurance.\n My mom lost her job and her home to foreclosure in 2008, and it devastated her. I’ve been very careful with my finances since my own bankruptcy in my early 20s. I finally find myself in a good financial position, albeit with an unknown professional future. I feel like this might finally be my chance to own a home, but that comes with risks. What would you do? Would you take the plunge into home ownership?\n UPDATE:\n Thank you all for the great advice! I am going to keep throwing money into my emergency fund until I have a 12 month buffer at the higher cost of owning. I will to continue to contribute to my Roth IRA, but divert my 401k contributions to the emergency fund for now.

My friend just retired after 15 years of service as a senior accountant only making $80k, if that shows how terrible the pay is.\n    submitted by    /u/StrikingParfait2285  \n [link]   [comments]",

Aka the best performers are people that just leave there money in market (because they didn't even know they had an account).\n My question is, what happens to these accounts when these people die?

          "description": "I've seen quite a few posts on here about not contributing to a 529 because you might lose aid. The reality is that most aid these days is in the form of federal loans (subsidized if you are lucky) as declining college enrollment is limiting scholarships and hammering college budgets. The good news is that the 529 is a great way to get a discount on college and get compounding growth.\n My son starts college in fall and I looked back today to see how much out of my pocket I would be paying:\n 529 Savings: $133,718\n 529 Principal: $71904\n So out of my bank account, originally, I put in $71k. I dumped in $1000 the day he was born, and started at $100/mo. Everytime I got a raise I would bump this by $20-$30/mo until I got to $300/mo and as of now I've stopped entirely. I also had this in what my state called Aggressive Age Based portfolio, not the no-risk/low-risk options and the last 15 years of returns really helped.\n Additionally, I got a 4.6% tax benefit on the principal in Colorado which means my real out of pocket was $68,596. This is still a lot of money, but its not so bad over 18 years. And now I probably won't pay anything out of my actual bank account for 4 years in-state and no hope or wishful thinking about \"financial aid\".\n College isn't for everyone of course, but with the recent tax law changes around IRAs any left over money goes there and anything beyond that I will just hold for future grandkids.\n Edit: one other note. As a parent I am willing to fund 4 years of public college. I saw lots of kids in my high school choose \"a pretty campus\" and come out of a private school with an English degree and 100k in loans (in 1998). I went to a state engineering school, the campus was ugly, but I learned a lot and didn't pay through the nose. I think kids need to understand ROI even if you are paying. You want to go to Elon or Loyola Marymout? Better get a loan. \n    submitted by    /u/DoubtHot6072  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of my coworkers did recommend me to Ameriprise and the advisor there wanted to open a brokerage account and do all sorts of stuff. Frankly, that whole conversation was a lot and I still haven’t said yes to it. So I am posting here to push me to learn about finances. Here is a quick background of my finances: making 84k in Texas, do 8% to my 401k for company match of 6%. I have a HSA and started to contribute $40 bucks every paycheck so $80 monthly. I have roughly $54k in savings, $19k in checking , and a Roth IRA with 6k invested and 3k not yet invested. My take home pay after taxes and insurances is $4700, minus rent/card is $2,300. I have no debt but right now I live with my mom and brother and take care of most of our bills due to my mom loosing her job. Within the next year, my goal is to purchase a house and move out but still plan to contribute some towards my mom. So should I max out my Roth IRA for this year since I still have time to contribute? Is Fidelity Go worth it while I figure stuff out ? Should I just invest in one stock like S&P500 or multiple ?

          "description": "I’m sadly having to put down my old 2005 Lexus with 280k miles due to some unsolvable issues. It kills me because I can’t stand the thought of a car payment. I try to live as frugal as possible maxing out IRA, deferred comp contributions, etc. I figure a lease is a waste of time. I know this might also just be preference as well. \n I have around 9 months of living expenses in a high yield. I could throw 10k cash at a used well-taken care of vehicle with high mileage…however, that would wipe out nearly 50% of that emergency fund…. Or put down a decent down payment on a 4-5 year old reliable vehicle then throw as much money at it is as I can to lessen the length of financing while still maxing IRA. I’m between being tired of driving around 10-15 year old cars….but then I’m also scared of a car payment. My only debt is my mortgage. Any advice would be awesome 😎 \n    submitted by    /u/No_Perspective6456  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Background: Single mother. Got laid off from my teaching position last year and only found part time work as a tutor this year. Then my child’s father passed away so I lost child support (getting survivor benefits now, but it still set me back). I nearly lost my car to repossession, nearly lost auto insurance, and I’m 2-4 payments behind on all of my credit cards. No savings.\n Current: With my daughter’s SS payments, our rent and groceries should be paid for going forward. But I’m still behind on everything else except the car and barely in the black. Because I went from full time to part time, I got a huge amount back on my tax refund. Over $10k. I first paid back family I had borrow money from these past few months, so that was around $3k. I have about 7k left to set myself up for success here. I’ll save $1k for an emergency fund, so that’s $6k left.\n Hopefully I will find a full time job next year, but this summer I won’t have a consistent income at all (unless I get a summer school position, which I have applied for).\n Question: I have about $10k in high interest credit card debt spread across four cards. My worst one is $5k. $200 monthly payment. 29% interest. Currently four months behind but started a payment plan. Obviously I could just pay that entire amount off now.\n But I also have a shitty 2014 Kia Soul with $4k left to pay it off. It costs me $220 a month in car payments at 12% interest, plus $200 in full coverage insurance. Part of me wants to pay this off first because when I get behind they threaten to repossess it, and I would be so fucked if that happened. I think I’d also reduce my insurance coverage to save money there.\n Obviously the credit card has a higher interest rate, but paying off the car would give me more security over the next few months until I (hopefully) find full time work.\n Then again, I could pay off the card first, and apply that extra $200 to my car to pay it off faster but not if I can’t find steady summer work.\n    submitted by    /u/ThrowRAhedgehog24  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I live in a city with a very high COL (nyc). Additionally, I have a significant student loan debt of $77k CAD.

          "description": "Hi all, please be patient with me — I’m not a great writer.\n Recently I was in an accident and received some lawsuit money. It’s not millions or anything, but it’s a good amount and honestly I have no idea what to do with it besides maybe saving it for a rainy day or putting it in a high-yield savings account.\n I was really happy when I found out, but I also feel like I can’t tell anyone in real life because last time I had money, people started asking me for help and I ended up broke. When I turned 18 something similar happened and within a year I gave a lot away to family and spent a lot partying with friends. I always told myself if I ever got another chance, I’d do better.\n Right now I’ve managed to save about $10k on my own (mostly through Acorns), and this payout will add about another $20k. I do have around $40k in student loan debt and I’m going back to school soon.\n Part of me wants to just disappear, save it, maybe travel a little and keep the rest safe… but I really don’t trust my own money decisions yet.\n Funny enough, before this happened I kept telling myself I was already rich in spirit and doing a lot of “money manifestation” mindset work. My goal this year was to reach $100k net worth and this payout basically got me about 30% of the way there, which makes me really happy. At the same time, it kind of sucks because I feel like I can’t really tell anyone in my real life without it turning into people asking me for money.\n If you were in my situation, what would you do first?\n Serious advice only please :)\n TLDR: Accident → payout → suddenly responsible adult with ~$30k and no clue what to do.

This puts us in a good position and we are planning to put an extension on the house at around 1300 square feet with a full basement foundation. Unfortunately the quote came back at around 450k with everything included (we are in a very expensive area of upstate NY) and Im starting to wonder if this is the best option? We could buy a house in the area around that same price but we would be sacrificing a lot in terms of peace and quiet and everything we have built up on the acreage. Another option would be to subdivide the lot and start over and build a new, bigger house on the existing lot and rent out the house we are currently living in but the enormity of that project starting from scratch is a bit daunting.

My first bill was for April 16th for 286$\n I paid $1,000 on Feb 12th and this went directly to the principal and interest. \n My goal originally was to pay 1k total each payment so $286 regular payment +714$ directly to principal each month. I was planning on doing this for 6 months than refinancing.\n However when I paid my first 1k, they pushed my first bill date back 3 months. My first payment is now not due till July. I called and asked and the money did go directly to my principal but they gave me a grace period for good will or something (I suspect this is to make it seem like I don't have to pay my bill so they make interest)\n Thanks to my tax return and a bonus at work, I was able to pay another 2k directly towards the principal minus the 15.81$ interest (Over only like 5 days man do I hate interest) \n My question is if I want to refinance when would be the best time to do it.\n My current loan is 13,490$ of the 17,400. \n I want to get a rate that is around 3-4% and shorten the length to about 36 months so I can just go to regular payments and not worry about the interest. While I can make the extra 714$ payment, it is not exactly comfortable.\n Should I just continue this schedule of paying 1k to my principal each month and pay a total of around 900-1,000 interest.\n Or should I look into refinancing?\n    submitted by    /u/Beautiful-Hawk-5240  \n [link]   [comments]",

My plan is to immediately pay off the $9k car loan because the interest rate is crazy high. That would leave me with about $21k.\n Monthly situation:\n  \nTake home: ~$2,500 (after 10% to TSP)\n Save: ~$400/month (Factored in take home pay)\n Car insurance: $200/month\n Subscriptions: <$60/month\n No rent\n  \nMain questions:\n  \nAfter paying off the car, should I wipe out the student loans? I'd rather just pay them off monthly instead of 16k all upfront especially as there's no large impact and I'll be making significantly more money in two years from now when they are no longer deferred\n Should I try to settle the two charged-off accounts even though I haven’t heard anything in years?\n Or is it smarter to build a large emergency fund first?\n What would help my credit score the most over the next 1–2 years?\n  \nGoals are to clean this up, improve my credit, and set myself up to buy a house in a few years.

          "description": "I’m from Korea and I came to the US when I was 13. My mom is in her 50s and currently she’s relying on me to cover her living expenses. She only gets one day temporary jobs here and there which does not cover a lot. She also has debt from borrowing from the banks for her living expenses and to do day trading.\n I’m writing here to see if any of you guys who are going through a similar situation like mine. I worked full time while studying full time to pay off my tuition and I’m kind of disheartened how I need to help my mom when she wasn’t able to do much for me when I was living in the US with my grandparents. Even when I try to say no, she guilt trips me and talks about how she might need to declare bankruptcy.\n Anyone in a similar situation like mine or any advice on this is appreciated.…",

This has always been a dream of mine, and I’m really excited — but now that it’s official, I’m trying to make sure I’m thinking about finances realistically.\n I make about $3.8–4k/month take-home. My rent is $1,425 + $90 utilities, and electric is estimated around ~$100. I also have about $900/month in student loans and a dog, so that adds to my monthly expenses.\n I’ve been at my job for a little over 2 years and things seem stable and trending positively. I also have a solid savings. I don’t feel reckless about the move — I just want to make sure I’m setting myself up well and not stretching too thin.\n For anyone who moved to a big city in their 20s with similar numbers, how did you balance being financially responsible while still actually enjoying the city?

It was my spouse’s childhood home, so there is significant emotional attachment.\n The house is currently rented and roughly covers the existing mortgage. Estimated value is $450k and still owe 85k on mortgage.\n However: • It needs approximately $50k in major, non-cosmetic repairs in the near term (roof, septic, furnace, oil tank). • The home has not had cosmetic updates in ~30 years. • It’s in a high property tax area.\n The sibling would like to be bought out. If we do that, we would need to refinance and take on a new loan. At current rates, the property would likely not fully cash flow. Rent would be close but would not cover principal + interest + taxes + insurance, especially once factoring in upcoming repairs.\n Additional context: • Our personal finances are not in strong shape. • We are carrying debt. • Our credit is not strong. • We are not being approved for favorable traditional loan terms. • We do not have sufficient reserves to comfortably absorb $50k in repairs. • We have young kids and other financial obligations.\n From a purely financial standpoint, selling and splitting proceeds would likely strengthen our situation and reduce risk.\n However, emotionally this is my spouse’s childhood home, and selling it feels like closing a chapter for him.\n My question isn’t just “does this cash flow?” I know the numbers are tight. It’s: how do couples responsibly weigh deep sentimental attachment against financial fragility?\n Is it ever reasonable to carry a property that doesn’t cash flow and needs major capital work if finances are already stretched?

Details below: \n Contributions: 401(k) $23,500 401(k) Match $9,823.18 ESOP est. $48,320.00 \n I have details from colleagues where this is handled automatically in May/June for the previous year when the contribution is finalized. However, I am also under the impression this excess contribution would be double taxed if not handled by April 15. Should I call my retirement plan manager now to withdraw an estimated amount? And then any minimal remaining excess would be subject to the double tax?\n    submitted by    /u/VeronicaVaughn2  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm 18 years old, and within the next few months I'm coming into around $160k that my mom put aside for me from around half of my father's life insurance payout. I've known about this for around 5 years, so it isn't unexpected. Despite this, the anxiety surrounding the lump sum is still overwhelming. I have read through this subreddit's wiki and some other advice, but I want more targeted information, and to be completely honest a lot of the information is flying over my head as I'm not financially literate/savvy.\n Here are some things I plan to do in the future: - 2 years of community college (free) --> transfer 2 years state school - Open a Roth IRA and put maximum contributions into it - Put a sum of money into a HYSA - Making diversified investments with a portion of the money (ie. ETFs, bonds, mutual funds) - Likely to be living with my mom for the next 4 years to maximize savings & help with mortgage - Discuss my situation to a non-commissioned financial advisor - Don't touch any of the lump sum unless absolutely necessary\n My mom is also urging me to not use a credit card as I can likely pay most things off with cash, but I don't know if that's the best option. I'll likely only open one credit card and make monthly subscription payments with it, paying it off immediately. I think it's a good fallback in case anything goes wrong, but I'm not an expert in credit and only have knowledge that's scraping the surface.\n Essentially, I would like to know if there are any glaring problems I should be considering in my future financial plan. I don't mind any longer reading materials if it's an investment for my future and well-being. \n    submitted by    /u/Wedding-Formal  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi there - this is about my mother, so any advice would be helpful.\n Background: My mother (F64), was mostly a stay at home mom for the majority of her working career - as she had 6 kids. My dad then walked out on all of us, leaving my mom to go back to school to get her degree and teaching credentials so she could teach Special Education. So she finally has been working in special education at a Charter school (not public) for the last 5 years. (Note - my mother found out years later they weren’t legally married - she found out at city hall when she went to file divorce papers)\n Finances: Because she was a stay at home mom for so long, we are assuming her SS is going to be fairly small. Additionally, she only started a 401k a few years back but only about $5k in it. Thankfully she has no debt.\n Question: How should I help her to plan for any kind of retirement? At this point is maxing out her 401k her best option? Her employer doesn’t match - so should we skip 401k and put it into straight into an IRA? What will give her the most flexibility and biggest return since we don’t really want to wait 30 years for it to grow.\n Note: One of us kids are planning to take her in when she gets older, but she’s young enough now that she loves her freedom and even her mother at 88 currently lives by herself because she likes the freedom.\n    submitted by    /u/Proof-Credit2161  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, I am in need of a new vehicle and need help deciding what to do. I have a 2011 Hyundai that has slowly become a money pit. I bought the car in 2021 and after thousands in repairs, new problems continue to come up and I've decided I am done with it. I am 27 and I have only ever bought older used cars in cash.\n I started looking for another vehicle and have test driven a bunch of cars and I have not been happy with any of them. I planned on using ~15k cash to get a used car, nothing special but I am hoping for something with known reliability (Honda or Toyota). But so far every car I've looked at in this range is just not worth the money, high miles, lots of cosmetic damage, or obvious mechanical issues. I even stretched to look at cars closer to 20k and seeing many cars in that price range with over 100k miles and the condition some were in was ridiculous to me. \n So I learned that it appears the used car market has had quite the shift and used car prices have exploded. So for the first time ever I am considering buying a new car instead of saving $5-10k to buy a used car that I'll have to replace much sooner. I am looking at the 2026 base model Civic which is around $26k. I currently make $67k (~$4500 net/mo) with no debt other than a cheap mortgage and my monthly expenses including \"extra/fun\" money comes out to about $2000. On a rough estimate, I believe close to 15k down and hopefully a bit of trade in value, it looks like I might be looking at a $250-300 payment for 60 months. \n Considering I hope to keep the car for 10+ years, is this a good idea? Or a completely horrible idea and I should keep looking for a used car? \n    submitted by    /u/wonder-egg  \n [link]   [comments]",

Family has stopped me from leaving before.\n Some financial info; I make $85k working mostly remote (very seldom do I have to travel or commute), have $35k in Roth IRA, $7k in 401k, $1k in HSA, $45k across savings, checking, and brokerage accounts, $21k student debt, and annual expenses are approx $5k (internet, auto insurance, student loans, trash). This is my split of bills I pay for the household internet, trash, an all auto vehicle insurance. I do not pay for food or rent. This wasnt set up, it just everyone happened to pick certain bills they can help with.\n My relationship with family is very strained. I won’t go into detail but I will just say that I am completely isolated at home. I work remotely so I need quiet space and have had this issue with my family previously but they moved me into a room that used to be a garage and is close to the laundry and food pantry. There is a lot of activity during the day (we are all 7 living in the same house) and they would turn the washer and dryer during my work hours even though this was communicated before. Long story short, even before this, my relationship with them was never close and it comes from years of conflict. \n But they won’t let me move out. This is more culturally than financially because I’m a woman and blah blah women should stay home until marriage. \n I need to make a decision and need help with determining if I should buy a home with my sister or rent. I feel like renting is such a waste but also understand that buying coming with a lot of expenses im not ready for. \n Would the best option for me be to rent a small studio maximum $1700 rent, or buy a small condo at a max of $300k? \n    submitted by    /u/No-Smell5410  \n [link]   [comments]",

I need someone financially savvy to tell me which one is actually the safest bet, because I am terrified of hidden fees.\n **Quote 1 (Ryder Relocations - The Broker): $2,400**\n * _The catch:_ It’s a 'Non-Binding' volume estimate. My research on Reddit shows they act as a broker and sell the job to a third-party driver.

They put it in writing that they do a strict numbered inventory, do not use transfer warehouses, and use their own dedicated crew for the entire PA to FL drive. The price legally cannot change.\n **Quote 3 (United Van Lines - Major Corporate): $6,800**\n * _The catch:_ It’s based on weight.

My total salary is 140k with 25k stock, and I'm in NYC. \n I get access to a 401k with max $12,500 employer contribution, ESPP that I can contribute 1-15% of my paycheck to, and a HSA. What is worth prioritizing my money towards first? I was trying to max out my 401k, then $200 per paycheck to HSA then I'm lost about ESPP. How much should I be trying to put towards ESPP? I'm still trying to get a budget figured out. Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Alert-Knee8445  \n [link]   [comments]",

Looking into Experian, the charged amount was $3300. Of note, I recently signed up for Experian alerts after freezing my credit. The account says it was opened in 2010 on Experian. I have no record of this account and when I talked with a Chase representative, they say my only credit card with them has a zero balance. I typed in the last 4 of the account in question and Chase says it’s not an account with them. It says I am an authorized user on Experian, my parents don’t have any Chase cards and I’ve never been on any of their cards as a User. Same with other relatives\n So far so I have: - sent a secure message to Chase with pictures from Experian of this account in question - filed a dispute with all 3 credit bureaus\n What the heck is going on? It doesn’t even seem like this account exists with Chase! Chase was super unhelpful and confused as well and I’ve been unable to talk to Experian.

          "description": "I’m about to work two jobs. My “main“ job is a part time job at a grocery store, which has been cutting my hours and the store director gets in a mood whenever we stay over so more often than not it’s not an option. They never promote any full time workers, so getting full time is extremely unlikely. I told myself I either need to find a better job or a second job.\n So far the only other place to have contacted me back and hire me is another grocery store. I’ll be working morning and mid shifts at the first one, closing at the second.\n Issue is, the hours of my first job fluctuate— I can be working less then 20 hours for months, but then suddenly be working over 30 hours, six days a week, the next couple weeks. Which means I can be working 50+ hours some weeks with two jobs. I also have my benefits and paid vacations at the first job that I’m reluctant to lose right away and start over at another job.\n However, I need the finances. I’m in student loan debt, have to pay for my own groceries, am trying to move out of a toxic household, and would need to eventually pay for other expenses later on. Working at my inconsistent first job alone isn’t enough anymore if I’m going to survive off only $200 each week on my low weeks.\n I am worried about burn out, though, and the lack of a social life and time to myself. Since my off days are inconsistent at both jobs, I can’t guarantee any days off unless I request off (and since I’m opening at the one, closing at the other, my whole day will be booked). I am going to see how it goes and if I can’t handle it, I’ll quit one of the jobs. I’ll also continue looking for better jobs and side hustles in the meantime. \n But I just wanted to ask if it’s worth doing two jobs in my circumstances? I know the answer seems obvious. But I’m just worried about burn out. At the very least, any tips on how to endure and not feel so burn out?\n    submitted by    /u/TheCrazyOutcast  \n [link]   [comments]",

I got in touch with someone from their “office of the president” who played phone tag with me for a week and then claimed the matter was resolved in an email. \n I got sick of it and went to Verizon. ATT sent me a bill for 800. They charged my credit card which I disputed because I did nott consent to that charge. I logged in to my att portal and it shows I have a negative balance of $765. \n What is the best course of action here?\n    submitted by    /u/muddywaffles86  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I currently hold over $10k in a HYSA. My living expenses are roughly $1k-1.5k a month (renting from friend's parent) and I make on average $3.2k a month (Contract work). Got nailed by taxes pretty hard ($6k), and I'm looking at how to plan moving forward outside of memorizing the tax code for my state lol.\n My original plan was to set up a sinking fund to cover moving out expenses (10%) and put 15% into the Rath. However that plan needs to be put on pause for obvious reasons. Now I could dip into my efund and simply adjust said plan, with the 15% going into rebuilding it and the 10% going into the IRA, but while these taxes are definitely scary, I think I can pay them off with monthly payments and by filing an extension. I had no issues paying them off last year, so I don't have a negative reputation with the IRS. That and the last thing I need is to pay off taxes only for an actual emergency to happen.\n What do yall think? Is this a sound approach to dealing with these expenses? Would you deem taxes a suitable emergency? Should I drop everything (including the Rath) to pay these off (Baby Step 2)? Would love your feedback.\n If I don't respond immediately, I'm on the way home. Thanks everyone!\n    submitted by    /u/TotalLeeAwesome  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I know the topic of including international stocks has come up a few times this week, but I finally made the change. A few years ago I read The Simple Path to Wealth and started following it's principles, not perfectly, but as well as I could in my situation with a young family. I have been watching VXUS over the past year due to seeing an interview with J.L. where he mentioned that he would tell his daughter to watch out for international stocks starting to outperform U.S. stocks due to changes in the global economy. When I saw his blog post this month, I decided to include international stocks as well and I intend to be invested in them long term. \n I saw another post here that recommended moving all stocks to VT for it's simplicity and just let it ride. However, isn't cost also a major factor? I wanted to keep an eye on costs and implement this in the most cost effective way possible. What I did is take a portion from VTI and move it to VXUS, which will give me a better expense ratio and have very similar performance as just holding VT. VT has an expense ratio of .06%, VXUS is .05%, and VTI is .03%. So, for example, if I have a total of $10,000 invested with approximately $6,000 in VTI and $4,000 (about 60% U.S. and 40% international) I'm only paying .03% for the bulk of my stock portfolio and .05% for the international component instead of .06% to hold everything in one fund. It's easy for me to rebalance to keep about the same ratios as VT as well because I add to the fund throughout the year and can add a little more to VTI or more to VXUS to keep in line with VT. What are some of the arguments against this approach? Is it just for simplicity and not tinkering with your investments?\n    submitted by    /u/RandomThings365  \n [link]   [comments]",

If the Roth IRA is so great, why wouldn't you want to also do a Roth 401(k)? It seems like they adhere to the same taxation rules, so is there something substantially different about Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA accounts that make them fundamentally different animals that I'm just not aware of? Maybe it's simply for diversification? The only real difference I've heard is that Roth IRAs typically allow for more aggressive investment options and the ability to withdraw contributions easier, but that's about it.\n My job allows me to contribute to a traditional and/or Roth 401(k) with a match up to 4% - my understanding is if I were to switch to a Roth percentage, their match would still go to a traditional, pre-tax account instead - and I'm currently maxing it out on the traditional side while maxing a separate Roth IRA. I'm not uncomfortable with that arrangement, but it still irks me not understanding what makes a Roth 401(k) \"bad\" but a Roth IRA \"good\" in the eyes of a lot of people (I know it's largely subjective and relative to individuals' goals, but you know what I mean), when they're like... the same thing as far as I can tell.\n Thanks in advance for any information.\n    submitted by    /u/spongebobstyle  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Im 24, my knowledge on finances are slim and I am terrified for my mom.\n She is in her late 60’s, working overtime just to survive, going through a divorce with my dad and has a new worrying intake of alcohol.\n Shes started on dating apps and lost $6000 by sending it to her “boyfriend” overseas. I didnt know until it happened, uploaded his picture to google and found the guy her scammer was posing as. This was around 6 months ago, that $6000 was basically her whole savings. I put parental controls on her phone which she was okay with and it worked for a while but she decided she wanted to try again.\n She showed me a check her new “boyfriend” sent to her house, for $900,000 in his name, which was obviously fake. She didnt know it was fake but was worried so she showed it to me. I used the same method and found who this scammer was posing as.\n Do you have any tips on protecting her finances?\n *Edit*\n She realizes her mistakes and has been asking me for help. I dont want to take complete control of her finances, I just want to help her not loose large sums of money.\n    submitted by    /u/Empty-Conclusion-359  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Don't get an expensive master's degree unless you truly need it for career advancement (i.e., you have a very concrete and realistic plan of how you will pay for it). \n I am a teacher at a private boarding school in Massachusetts. A lot of my colleagues found themselves in the workforce for a few years, usually as teachers, then decided that their life felt stagnant and got a master's degree from places like Columbia or whatever. They figured it was a logical next move as a typical \"striver\" who wants to achieve the next milestone in life, assuming it would lead to new opportunities. Underrated fact: even at places like Harvard, many of these master's degrees are not particularly selective and will enroll almost any baseline smart/competent person - they're a cash cow for the university primarily used to fund their PhD programs! \n Anyways, these people end up in serious debt and forego earnings while getting the degrees, sometimes in excess of $100,000. And what did they do with their degree? They went back to teaching - basically the exact same job they already had with the same earning potential. \n I'm curious if this is a pattern in other lines of work - do any of your coworkers also randomly get masters degree at enormous expense that they don't put to good use? In my opinion you should only go to graduate school for a profession that truly requires the credential (JD, MD, etc), or if you get it funded (via a PhD program or through your employer).\n    submitted by    /u/NotAGoldenRetriever  \n [link]   [comments]",
