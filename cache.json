          "description": "讲到结婚，很多情侣都会面对现实两个字——钱。 近日，大马一名男子在 Facebook「B神 BGod」匿名发文表示，自己今年 33 岁，月薪 RM3000+。虽然收入不算高，但他一直努力工作，也认真为未来打算。 他和女朋友交往多年。女友常说一句话： 「没有屋子，不要结婚。结婚一定要有自己的家。」 他其实认同。以现在马来西亚的房价来说，租屋确实让人没有安全感。所以这两年里，他开始拼命存钱，减少出门娱乐，少和朋友聚会，能省就省，只希望早一点存够首期。 可是，问题慢慢出现了。 女友一边说要存钱买屋子，一边却喜欢买名牌包、换新手机，还要求他带她去网红餐厅打卡拍照。她常说：「现在不享受，等几时？」在她看来，女生爱美很正常，而男朋友愿意花钱，是一种疼爱。 一开始，他也觉得偶尔宠一下没关系。但后来，情况变了。iPhone 是他刷卡，旅行是他刷卡，生日礼物是他刷卡。甚至有时候她说：「你帮我签一下先，下个月我给你。」结果分期付款却落在他的名下。 久而久之，他身上多了一笔信用卡债务，而那是为了她而签下的。 当他提起压力，说自己很辛苦时，女友却反过来说他不够上进。她说，如果真的想娶她，就应该更努力赚钱，而不是一直讲压力。 他开始矛盾，觉得男人多承担一点，好像是理所当然。但是，他不明白，如果目标是买屋结婚，为什么生活方式却一直在消耗？他说，现在自己越来越害怕提到「钱」这个字。因为只要一谈钱，女友就觉得他计较。 这篇贴文引起不少网民热议 ▼ 分！ ▼ 把人家当 ATM？ ▼ 够力！这名男子最后问道：「在马来西亚，如果一个女生坚持要有屋子才结婚，却同时不断增加开销，到底是男生能力不够，还是这段关系一开始就出是错的？」\nThe post 嫌男友月薪RM3K买不起屋子，却刷他的卡买iPhone、买名牌！ appeared first on Moretify.",

          "description": "新年要扮美美，不少人都会提前做好「变美三宝」，像是做美发、护肤、美甲等。然而，在追求精致外观的背后，可能隐藏着你意想不到的受伤风险。 中国杭州一名 22 岁女子日前做了一款心仪已久的美甲，没想到在隔天骑电动摩托时发生意外，导致指甲连同甲床断裂，甚至引发指骨骨折。 根据《新民晚报》报道，王姓女子为了让手指看起来更修长，还特意贴了延长甲片。不料，她隔天骑车时却不慎摔倒，手掌本能撑地，结果导致左手食指上的延长甲片连同甲床直接断裂流血。她随即前往杭州市临平区中西医结合医院骨科就诊。 经检查发现，王女左手食指出现指骨骨折、甲床破裂，部分甲床外露，必须通过手术修复。院方为她进行指骨骨折闭合复位内固定手术，目前术后恢复情况良好。 接诊的曹立副主任医师指出，如果没有这么细长复杂的美甲，伤势也许不会这么严重。其延长甲片会增加手指的受力面积和杠杆作用，一旦摔倒，很容易产生撬动效应，导致指甲撕脱、甲床损伤，甚至引发骨折。 曹医师也表示，虽然王女情况属于极端个例，但美甲确实会影响手部正常活动，而且指甲造型越复杂，影响就越明显。频繁做美甲或做不当美甲，存在不少健康隐患。 例如，打磨甲面容易让甲层变薄易断；美甲环境不卫生，可能引发指甲真菌感染；频繁去死皮、使用卸甲水或甲油胶等，可能增加过敏性皮肤病或感染性皮肤病等疾病风险；若美甲油质量不佳，还可能诱发呼吸疾病。 此外，曹医师还提醒指甲的生长周期一般为 3 个月，因此两次美甲最好间隔 3 个月以上，且不建议选择过于复杂或者带有突出装饰的款式。 美甲不是不能做，是要适度，别让一时爱美换来受伤和健康代价。\nThe post 美甲做太长！22岁女子跌摩托意外手指骨折！医生：本来不会这么严重 appeared first on Moretify.",

Follow today’s news live\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nAnthony Albanese says former opposition leader, Sussan Ley was “undermined” by conservative colleagues, Angus Taylor and Andrew Hastie, during her 276-day tenure in the seat.\nSpeaking to Hit 104.9, which covers Ley’s southern NSW electorate of Farrer, the prime minister criticised the Coalition’s recent internal turmoil while praising his own side of politics. Albanese said:\nFrom day one, she was undermined by Angus Taylor and Andrew Hastie and a range of them who weren’t really working to try to get her success in the party. …\nIt’s, I think, unfortunate that politics can be a pretty rough game, and that [Ley] was elected by the Liberal party caucus, fair and square, she was the leader, but never even got to give a budget reply. I don’t know if that’s happened before. I’m not sure, but certainly she didn’t even get one year in the office, which is pretty rough.\nWe want to ensure that people who leave our country and go to terrorist hotspots, people who go there to support terrorist organisations or to support Islamic State or organisations or other terror listed organisations, and then who actually commit crimes over there … they can’t come back to Australia.\nI’ve got a newsflash for the government. They are the government. They can change the law. If the law is not strong enough to keep Australians safe and to keep people out who actually hate Australian values and hate the Australian way of life, and who have left our country to fight for an alternate way of life, then we should change those laws.\n Continue reading...",

On one side is a Christian nationalist stream of the Maga movement, which views the United States’s close relationship with Israel with increasing suspicion.

I have a background in maths and finance, and I've been working on a set of trading strategies for FX and stocks, currently looking to paper trade before deploying fully through an algorithm. Whats a good platform to use? For stocks I currently have moomoo, but idk how it would work with my automation. Also how would capital gains tax work if im regularly buying and selling a stock?\n As far as FX goes, is there a good platform that is safe? I'm finding it hard to get good advice on it because most people i know who trade Forex are those Forex bros using dodgy unregulated platforms like Justmarket that offer up to 3000x leverage which i think is kinda predatory. I have worked in asset management before and done some investing but pretty clueless as far as actual active day trading goes. Whats a good pip spread for currency pairs like USD/EUR? which platforms offer them, and as far as leverage goes whats a healthy and safe range I could play with or do you think it would be better to stay clear of that?\n Let me know what you think.\n    submitted by    /u/fuckosta  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our thought is, rather than splitting up assets and giving this sibling this or that to individually manage, it would be better financially to put everything in a trust or a company and have all sibling manage/share it equally. The basic thinking is that we can do more when we pool our assets all together. From what I’ve read online there are some pros to doing this, protection of assets in case of bankruptcy, and more structured financial planning for future generations..\n I’ve briefly talked to some people (relatives who are in a related field) and so far the initial reaction I get is not to do it because it usually causes rifts in the family but when I dig deeper the cause of that is usually because nobody discusses or agrees to exit terms beforehand.\n So, leaving out family dynamics, just wanted some input on whether it financially makes sense and if so what are technical ways to do this?

          "description": "Happy CNY / holidays guys!\n 29M data analyst here. I’ve been in retail for about 4 years (2 companies). With retail volatility lately, company performance has been quite affected. I recently received a contract offer from a major insurance company in KL. +23% from my current permanent role, with 2 days WFH.\n The downside as you know is that it’s a contract role, so there’s always the uncertainty of renewal/absorption. That said, since it’s a big player in the industry, I’m quite tempted to give it a try.\n Wondering what people think about insurance industry as a whole? I've heard some say with premium prices going up, people might stop paying insurance. \n The industry is totally new to me so any thoughts is appreciated. \n    submitted by    /u/Yenrusu  \n [link]   [comments]",

These are my stats:\n  \nBase: RM5,900 /month\n (Fixed) Travel Allowance: RM1,000 /month\n (Fixed) Misc Allowance: RM400 /month\n  \nIn your experience, do new employers usually consider your base salary or overall total salary when offering a salary package?

Unfortunately, I have to rehome her, and I'm desperately seeking helpful advice on how to make this process easier for both her and myself.\n I've been planning to immigrate to Australia from Malaysia for a few months now. While I'm excited about this new chapter in my life, I am also heartbroken that I need to rehome my cat. I can't take her with me due to the strict pet relocation rules in Australia, and Malaysia is not an approved country for relocating pets. Even if it was, I wouldn't have the financial means to cover the expenses.\n Has anyone here gone through a similar situation?

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I’m from Sarawak, and I would like to respectfully seek guidance regarding a family heirloom . It is an old Iban Kain Kumbu textile that has been passed down through approximately 4–5 generations in my family.... l am not sure but would like to ask an expert about this!!\n Family lineage timeline:\n • My late great-great grandmother • Passed down to my late great grandmother • Then to my grandmother • Then to my mother • Now in my possession \n According to my mother’s oral history, this textile was worn by an ancestor named Niang Inik Kantan. The longhouse origin is unfortunately unknown as most elders in our family have passed away sadly no information was to further explaining more about this Kain Kumbu\n The piece appears:\n • Handwoven • Naturally dyed (earth tones, deep browns, muted red/blue) • Smaller in size compared to modern 1970s–1990s Kain Kumbu • In good structural condition • Has a natural woody scent consistent with aged textile storage \n I am genuinely seeking:\n 1. Advice on authentication. 2. How to verify age (pre-1900? 1800s?). 3. Whether museum textile experts in Sarawak or Malaysia would be appropriate to consult. 4. General historical context of early Kain Kumbu weaving. \n I deeply respect its cultural and spiritual value, and I want to approach this carefully and correctly. Because this is from our family heirloom and been on generations...\n Any guidance from historians, textile experts, collectors, or museum professionals would be sincerely appreciated.\n Thank you.\n Comparison size to the modern one on second photo..\n    submitted by    /u/Future_Discipline184  \n [link]   [comments]",

The university advertises that students who take x or more credits (which I qualfiied for) \"do not pay copays or coinsurance for provider visits at [name]! \" . I also asked the front-desk if/how much would be billed to insurance, and they said that it should be covered for students. It turned out to be the flu, and the only thing that the medical staff member did was give me a flu and covid test. The next day, I am completely fine and recover on my own after the week-ish of abnormal shivers and sickness. I would have never went to the student care if they provided price transparency instead of deceiving students.\n I then get a bill for ~$400, and although insurance adjusted it by a bit, it's still $300. It's not covered by insurance because my insurance has a high deductible.\n I have heard that you can negotiate even if you have insurance, so long as you are willing to pay immediately. If they bring the bill down to a REASONABLE amount ($100-150), I would be able to pay immediately.\n Can someone please provide me with some tips to negotiate this urgent care visit given the circumstances of me being a student (I still am a student) and it being health services provided by the university?\n    submitted by    /u/Dramatic_Fly6177  \n [link]   [comments]",

Looking into Experian, the charged amount was $3300. Of note, I recently signed up for Experian alerts after freezing my credit. The account says it was opened in 2010 on Experian. I have no record of this account and when I talked with a Chase representative, they say my only credit card with them has a zero balance. I typed in the last 4 of the account in question and Chase says it’s not an account with them. It says I am an authorized user on Experian, my parents don’t have any Chase cards and I’ve never been on any of their cards as a User. Same with other relatives\n So far so I have: - sent a secure message to Chase with pictures from Experian of this account in question - filed a dispute with all 3 credit bureaus\n What the heck is going on? It doesn’t even seem like this account exists with Chase! Chase was super unhelpful and confused as well and I’ve been unable to talk to Experian.

          "description": "I’m about to work two jobs. My “main“ job is a part time job at a grocery store, which has been cutting my hours and the store director gets in a mood whenever we stay over so more often than not it’s not an option. They never promote any full time workers, so getting full time is extremely unlikely. I told myself I either need to find a better job or a second job.\n So far the only other place to have contacted me back and hire me is another grocery store. I’ll be working morning and mid shifts at the first one, closing at the second.\n Issue is, the hours of my first job fluctuate— I can be working less then 20 hours for months, but then suddenly be working over 30 hours, six days a week, the next couple weeks. Which means I can be working 50+ hours some weeks with two jobs. I also have my benefits and paid vacations at the first job that I’m reluctant to lose right away and start over at another job.\n However, I need the finances. I’m in student loan debt, have to pay for my own groceries, am trying to move out of a toxic household, and would need to eventually pay for other expenses later on. Working at my inconsistent first job alone isn’t enough anymore if I’m going to survive off only $200 each week on my low weeks.\n I am worried about burn out, though, and the lack of a social life and time to myself. Since my off days are inconsistent at both jobs, I can’t guarantee any days off unless I request off (and since I’m opening at the one, closing at the other, my whole day will be booked). I am going to see how it goes and if I can’t handle it, I’ll quit one of the jobs. I’ll also continue looking for better jobs and side hustles in the meantime. \n But I just wanted to ask if it’s worth doing two jobs in my circumstances? I know the answer seems obvious. But I’m just worried about burn out. At the very least, any tips on how to endure and not feel so burn out?\n    submitted by    /u/TheCrazyOutcast  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I know the topic of including international stocks has come up a few times this week, but I finally made the change. A few years ago I read The Simple Path to Wealth and started following it's principles, not perfectly, but as well as I could in my situation with a young family. I have been watching VXUS over the past year due to seeing an interview with J.L. where he mentioned that he would tell his daughter to watch out for international stocks starting to outperform U.S. stocks due to changes in the global economy. When I saw his blog post this month, I decided to include international stocks as well and I intend to be invested in them long term. \n I saw another post here that recommended moving all stocks to VT for it's simplicity and just let it ride. However, isn't cost also a major factor? I wanted to keep an eye on costs and implement this in the most cost effective way possible. What I did is take a portion from VTI and move it to VXUS, which will give me a better expense ratio and have very similar performance as just holding VT. VT has an expense ratio of .06%, VXUS is .05%, and VTI is .03%. So, for example, if I have a total of $10,000 invested with approximately $6,000 in VTI and $4,000 (about 60% U.S. and 40% international) I'm only paying .03% for the bulk of my stock portfolio and .05% for the international component instead of .06% to hold everything in one fund. It's easy for me to rebalance to keep about the same ratios as VT as well because I add to the fund throughout the year and can add a little more to VTI or more to VXUS to keep in line with VT. What are some of the arguments against this approach? Is it just for simplicity and not tinkering with your investments?\n    submitted by    /u/RandomThings365  \n [link]   [comments]",

He passed away unexpectedly a few weeks ago and we don’t know what to do about the loan. He was the only name on the loan, we have no estate because he didn’t have many assets or money. Nearly all of his bank accounts had me listed in trust and the house is in his and my mother’s name (she is still with us.) my mother is on Social Security and it may not be enough for her to live off of and keep the home, although we are going to try, but the loan will make it nearly impossible. I hate the idea of not paying a debt, but is there any option that allows us to have the loan forgiven due to his death?\n Also - the salesman for Erie specifically told my parents that if he were to die the loan would not have to be repaid, I feel like that was a predatory move on his part and not fully accurate.\n    submitted by    /u/Frozen_In_NY  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've spent a few hours trying to wrap my head around why people online (see here) are often adamant that a traditional 401(k) and Roth IRA is the way to go - especially with how high the praise is for the latter - yet I don't often see people talking about doing both a Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA. If the Roth IRA is so great, why wouldn't you want to also do a Roth 401(k)? It seems like they adhere to the same taxation rules, so is there something substantially different about Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA accounts that make them fundamentally different animals that I'm just not aware of? Maybe it's simply for diversification? The only real difference I've heard is that Roth IRAs typically allow for more aggressive investment options and the ability to withdraw contributions easier, but that's about it.\n My job allows me to contribute to a traditional and/or Roth 401(k) with a match up to 4% - my understanding is if I were to switch to a Roth percentage, their match would still go to a traditional, pre-tax account instead - and I'm currently maxing it out on the traditional side while maxing a separate Roth IRA. I'm not uncomfortable with that arrangement, but it still irks me not understanding what makes a Roth 401(k) \"bad\" but a Roth IRA \"good\" in the eyes of a lot of people (I know it's largely subjective and relative to individuals' goals, but you know what I mean), when they're like... the same thing as far as I can tell.\n Thanks in advance for any information.\n    submitted by    /u/spongebobstyle  \n [link]   [comments]",

A lot of my colleagues found themselves in the workforce for a few years, usually as teachers, then decided that their life felt stagnant and got a master's degree from places like Columbia or whatever. They figured it was a logical next move as a typical \"striver\" who wants to achieve the next milestone in life, assuming it would lead to new opportunities. Underrated fact: even at places like Harvard, many of these master's degrees are not particularly selective and will enroll almost any baseline smart/competent person - they're a cash cow for the university primarily used to fund their PhD programs! \n Anyways, these people end up in serious debt and forego earnings while getting the degrees, sometimes in excess of $100,000. And what did they do with their degree? They went back to teaching - basically the exact same job they already had with the same earning potential. \n I'm curious if this is a pattern in other lines of work - do any of your coworkers also randomly get masters degree at enormous expense that they don't put to good use? In my opinion you should only go to graduate school for a profession that truly requires the credential (JD, MD, etc), or if you get it funded (via a PhD program or through your employer).\n    submitted by    /u/NotAGoldenRetriever  \n [link]   [comments]",
