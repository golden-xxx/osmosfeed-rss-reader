          "description": "中国江西九江一名 00 后大学毕业生张瑾，以每月 200 元（约 113 令吉）租住养老院单间，并持续当志愿服务两年多，在网络引发关注。 综合媒体报导，张瑾于 2023 前往苏州工作，一次偶然刷手机时看到一则养老院招募志愿者的推文，内容写道：「年轻人为老人提供陪伴、娱乐、教学，就能以 200、300 元的月租入住养老院」。当时面临房租压力和独居的孤独感，加上养老院距离公司不远，便抱着试一试的心态报名，没想到一住，就爱上这里的生活。 张瑾周一至周五照常到公司上班，到了周末会在养老院当志工。她目前住在一个二十多平米的单间里，房间以原木风为主调，布置温馨舒适。她透露，在苏州正常租住普通房间，每月租金约 2000 元（约 1129 令吉），几乎占自己收入的一半。过去租房还需要父母补贴一点生活费，如今住进养老院后，房租压力大幅减轻。 她坦言，选择入住的原因之一是可享房租减免政策，另一个原因则是觉得很新颖、很好奇。自己刚到苏州时没有太多亲友，在养老院的生活不仅丰富了业余时间，也让她感受到亲人般的温暖，比职场更治愈人心。 据了解，该养老院的招聘条件，要求志愿者年龄必须在 35 岁以下、在苏州没有房子，并具备一定特长或爱好。当时共有 40-50 人报名，最终录取了 5 人。其志愿服务内容，主打一个倾听、一个陪伴，给老人家们提供情绪价值。 张瑾每个季度需完成 45 小时，每周平均不到 4 小时的志愿服务，内容包括陪老人聊天、组织活动、教手指舞和参与文娱互动等。完成规定时数后，可持续享 200 元月租。 她表示，与老人相处的氛围简单但真诚。在公司付出未必能获得肯定，但与老人们相处，无论做什么事，他们都会夸赞或表达感谢，从中收获的情感回馈远超过房租优惠。老人们的关心和陪伴，让她在异乡不再孤单，这种温暖是金钱买不到的。通过与长者相处，也让她学到了很多人生道理，变得更加成熟和坚强。 如今两年多过去，当初同时入选的几名年轻人因婚恋或工作变动陆续搬离，目前仅剩她一人继续居住。张瑾现在仍一边上班，一边从事志愿服务，暂无搬离打算，以后会根据未来职业和生活安排再作决定。\nThe post 比职场更治愈人心！00后女生月租RM113住养老院两年，收获亲人般的温暖！ appeared first on Moretify.",

          "description": "在马来西亚，舞狮不仅是节庆表演，更是一种陪伴我们长大的文化记忆。无论是新年开工、开张志庆，还是庙会巡游，总能看到醒狮队伍浩浩荡荡出发。而许多舞狮团平日出队时，都会乘坐罗里「lori」前往表演地点，这样的画面，对不少人来说早已司空见惯。 不过，近期一名网友却在 Facebook 发文诉苦被警察开 Saman！ 贴主：出了几十年的队，第一次给警察开saman，第一次听到出队的罗里不能载人。狮友们大家注意你们罗里，不能载人啊！我现在已经中了。 语气中满是无奈与愤怒，还提醒其他「狮友」要特别注意！帖文一出，很快引起关注。不少网民在评论区留言讨论，相关贴文的留言区几乎一面倒，认为无论是否为了舞狮出队，罗里本就不应该载人。有人指出，交通条例早有规定，货车或罗里属于载货用途车辆，若后方车斗并未设有合法座位与安全装置，载人本身就存在安全隐患。 也有网民理性表示，理解舞狮团体出队时为了方便，会选择集体乘坐同一辆 lori 前往表演场地，但若发生意外，后果不堪设想。「平时没事不代表合法」、「一旦紧急刹车或发生碰撞，车斗上的人是最危险的」，类似的留言不断出现。 或许这是长期以来的「行业习惯」。尤其是在一些社区或乡镇地区，舞狮团经费有限，租用巴士或安排多辆私家车接送，成本相对更高。使用 lori 载人，往往是为了节省开销与方便搬运器材，一车同时载狮头、鼓、旗帜及队员，看似效率更高。 不过，从法律与安全角度来看，不少网民仍强调，文化传承固然重要，但不应建立在违规或危险之上。也有人建议，相关单位或协会或许可以加强宣导，让舞狮团体更清楚交通规则，同时探讨是否有更安全的替代方案。 ▼ 双方都中？！ ▼ 看运气？ ▼ 原来如此 ▼ 经济路线 ▼ Opps ▼ 还能十个人？ ▼ erm... ▼ 看门就对了？ 舞狮作为马来西亚多元文化的一部分，一直深受社会重视。每逢佳节，醒狮高桩腾跃的画面，早已成为街头最热闹的风景。然而，这起事件也让不少人开始反思，在传承文化的同时，是否也需要与时并进，兼顾安全与合规。 目前，当事网友并未透露罚款金额，但其贴文已成功提醒不少「狮友」提高警惕。文化需要被珍惜，安全同样不能忽视。对此，你怎么看呢？ 来源：Facebook/Leo Lai\nThe post 出了几十年队第一次中SAMAN！舞狮罗里载人被开罚单引发热议！ appeared first on Moretify.",

          "description": "大马男子向 XUAN Facebook 专页投稿，控诉前妻婚后多次出车九，还把他当成 ATM，一年多内前后被 pian 了 7 次，令他身心俱疲。 两人于 2021 年通过交友网站认识，交往不久后就约见面，随后她就搬到古晋与他同居，并于 2023 年注册结婚。原以为人生步入稳定阶段的他，未料婚姻会在一年后出现裂痕。 2024 年 12 月，前妻频繁以「回槟城」为由离家，这期间机票由他承担。岂料，她实际并未返回槟城，而是另购机票飞去 KL！他发现不对劲后查询机票记录，并直接飞去机场等她。他接机时发现她身上出现草莓印，而对方却以「故意气他」为由解释，他最终选择相信。 此后情况愈发异常。前妻每月仅短暂回家几天，随后又飞往 KL，再后来甚至飞去中国。有次，他偶然在手机发现验孕棒的购买记录，时间点恰逢两人关系疏远之际，才意识到事情并不单纯！ 男子指出，婚后所有开销都由他承担，包括前妻的车贷、生活费以及多次旅行费用，数年累计超过 RM50,000。他崩溃地表示，自己不是在养老婆，而是在「赞助」她和别人同居。 更令他感到讽刺的是，他们刚认识时，前妻其实和另一名男子结过婚，还没离婚就搬来与他一起住，直到与前夫正式离婚后，才告诉他实情。由于当时正在准备注册结婚，所以选择原谅。 后来，他掌握到前妻与一名中国男子长期同居的证据。前妻的反复欺 pian 不仅导致婚姻破裂，更令他精神受创。他委任律师发出律师函，指控对方在明知女方已婚情况下发展不正当关系，要求停止相关行为、书面回应，并保留民事索赔权利。目前第一封律师函已送达，第二封正在准备中，接下来将正式提起诉讼。 最让他崩溃的是办理离婚手续时期，前妻深夜致电，要求他隔天前往 KL 接她，他毫不犹豫买机票飞过去。对方随后逼他签「和平离婚」，并承诺签字后他们可以重新开始，尽管心里很忐忑，但自己最后还是选择相信她。 然而，文件拿到手那天，她便返回槟城并失去联系。那一刻，他才明白对方从来没想过回头，和他离婚不是为了重新开始，而是为了彻底离开。 如今，前妻已更换电话号码，两人现在仅通过 Email 联系。这一年里，他自认被彻底利用，钱没了，婚姻没了，尊严也差点没了。经过反复利用后，他也逐渐清醒了，决定不再心软，已着手通过法律途径追究责任，为自己讨回一个公道。 我只是想问一句，为什么要这样玩我？ 如果她现在回来，我还会心软吗？ 我自己都不知道。 帖文曝光后，不少网民纷纷留言劝他放过自己，及时止损，别再为一个不值得的人内耗。\nThe post 被前妻Tipu了7次还不醒！大马「恋爱脑」男遭多次出车九，仍心软想复合！ appeared first on Moretify.",

          "description": "讲到结婚，很多情侣都会面对现实两个字——钱。 近日，大马一名男子在 Facebook「B神 BGod」匿名发文表示，自己今年 33 岁，月薪 RM3000+。虽然收入不算高，但他一直努力工作，也认真为未来打算。 他和女朋友交往多年。女友常说一句话： 「没有屋子，不要结婚。结婚一定要有自己的家。」 他其实认同。以现在马来西亚的房价来说，租屋确实让人没有安全感。所以这两年里，他开始拼命存钱，减少出门娱乐，少和朋友聚会，能省就省，只希望早一点存够首期。 可是，问题慢慢出现了。 女友一边说要存钱买屋子，一边却喜欢买名牌包、换新手机，还要求他带她去网红餐厅打卡拍照。她常说：「现在不享受，等几时？」在她看来，女生爱美很正常，而男朋友愿意花钱，是一种疼爱。 一开始，他也觉得偶尔宠一下没关系。但后来，情况变了。iPhone 是他刷卡，旅行是他刷卡，生日礼物是他刷卡。甚至有时候她说：「你帮我签一下先，下个月我给你。」结果分期付款却落在他的名下。 久而久之，他身上多了一笔信用卡债务，而那是为了她而签下的。 当他提起压力，说自己很辛苦时，女友却反过来说他不够上进。她说，如果真的想娶她，就应该更努力赚钱，而不是一直讲压力。 他开始矛盾，觉得男人多承担一点，好像是理所当然。但是，他不明白，如果目标是买屋结婚，为什么生活方式却一直在消耗？他说，现在自己越来越害怕提到「钱」这个字。因为只要一谈钱，女友就觉得他计较。 这篇贴文引起不少网民热议 ▼ 分！ ▼ 把人家当 ATM？ ▼ 够力！这名男子最后问道：「在马来西亚，如果一个女生坚持要有屋子才结婚，却同时不断增加开销，到底是男生能力不够，还是这段关系一开始就出是错的？」\nThe post 嫌男友月薪RM3K买不起屋子，却刷他的卡买iPhone、买名牌！ appeared first on Moretify.",

          "description": "新年要扮美美，不少人都会提前做好「变美三宝」，像是做美发、护肤、美甲等。然而，在追求精致外观的背后，可能隐藏着你意想不到的受伤风险。 中国杭州一名 22 岁女子日前做了一款心仪已久的美甲，没想到在隔天骑电动摩托时发生意外，导致指甲连同甲床断裂，甚至引发指骨骨折。 根据《新民晚报》报道，王姓女子为了让手指看起来更修长，还特意贴了延长甲片。不料，她隔天骑车时却不慎摔倒，手掌本能撑地，结果导致左手食指上的延长甲片连同甲床直接断裂流血。她随即前往杭州市临平区中西医结合医院骨科就诊。 经检查发现，王女左手食指出现指骨骨折、甲床破裂，部分甲床外露，必须通过手术修复。院方为她进行指骨骨折闭合复位内固定手术，目前术后恢复情况良好。 接诊的曹立副主任医师指出，如果没有这么细长复杂的美甲，伤势也许不会这么严重。其延长甲片会增加手指的受力面积和杠杆作用，一旦摔倒，很容易产生撬动效应，导致指甲撕脱、甲床损伤，甚至引发骨折。 曹医师也表示，虽然王女情况属于极端个例，但美甲确实会影响手部正常活动，而且指甲造型越复杂，影响就越明显。频繁做美甲或做不当美甲，存在不少健康隐患。 例如，打磨甲面容易让甲层变薄易断；美甲环境不卫生，可能引发指甲真菌感染；频繁去死皮、使用卸甲水或甲油胶等，可能增加过敏性皮肤病或感染性皮肤病等疾病风险；若美甲油质量不佳，还可能诱发呼吸疾病。 此外，曹医师还提醒指甲的生长周期一般为 3 个月，因此两次美甲最好间隔 3 个月以上，且不建议选择过于复杂或者带有突出装饰的款式。 美甲不是不能做，是要适度，别让一时爱美换来受伤和健康代价。\nThe post 美甲做太长！22岁女子跌摩托意外手指骨折！医生：本来不会这么严重 appeared first on Moretify.",

On one side is a Christian nationalist stream of the Maga movement, which views the United States’s close relationship with Israel with increasing suspicion. On the other is an older Christian conservative establishment that views that alliance as a totem of US foreign policy – and in some cases believes that Israeli Jews possess a divine right to a large swathe of the Middle East, US public opinion be damned.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Good morning, recently got an offer letter for this position in F&B industry and its my first time in this industry, was wondering what are the benefits usually company offer or employees should entitled to besides EPF, SOSCO and insurance. \n Details:\n Pay - RM3,600 ( <1 year experience, staff meals provided) \n Transportation: total around 3-3.5 hours travelling duration by car back and forth during peak hour ( no public transport nearby my area) \n Cost of driving : around RM10 or less with tols depends on which route waze lead me to. Petrol: around RM500-600 a month\n Parking: RM100-200 per month depends on which building has vancancy\n medical claim: RM500 a year on their specific panels\n The reason why I asked about opinions was the other company I interviewed ( not f&b) has more benefits like gym membership and so on. Is this how traditional f&b company offer?\n Thank you so much for your attention and would be appreciate with all the experienced sifus here! \n    submitted by    /u/SkyIntrepid7848  \n [link]   [comments]",

Instalment is about RM1.5k per month and we’re planning to rent it out this year. Expected rent should roughly cover the instalment.\n We are currently renting a place for 1.4k monthly. We’re now considering buying a landed home for own stay, price around RM930k to 1m.\n Plan is:\n • New landed under the other partner’s single name (lower income)\n • 35-year loan\n • Instalment estimated around low RM4k range\n • No other major commitments, no kids. Our average monthly expenses are about RM9k.\n Main concerns:\n • Is this too aggressive for our income level?\n • Would you wait longer before committing to a landed at this price?\n Appreciate any real life experiences, especially from those juggling mortgage + rental at the same time.\n Thanks in advance.\n TLDR:\n Early 30s couple, RM16k combined net income, holding 1 condo, considering RM930k landed under single name.

The scholarship covers:\n Full tuition\n On-campus accommodation\n Free campus Wi-Fi\n RM 400 monthly allowance\n Her family is low income. Realistically, her mother can only send an additional USD 100–150 per month.\n So in total, she would have roughly RM 830–1,050 per month for food, transport, phone, personal expenses, etc. (since accommodation and internet are covered).\n But we are worried about:\n Is this amount realistically enough in Alor Setar?\n What do students there actually spend monthly (without rent)?\n Are there hidden costs we should expect?\n How expensive is food near AIU?\n Is RM 800-1,000/month manageable or extremely stressful?\n This is a huge opportunity for her to leave Yemen and study abroad, so we don’t want her to reject it because of fear but we also don’t want her to struggle badly financially.\n If you’ve studied in Alor Setar (or Kedah), especially as an international student, could you share your real monthly spending and whether this budget is feasible?\n Thank you so much.

My mortgage + maintenance for my property is about RM3.5k/month. Even after rental, I still top up RM1.5k monthly for a house I don’t live in.\n When I bought the place years ago, I was earning significantly more. I took a 25-year loan because it made sense then. Since then, I’ve had a career change and my income is lower. I don’t regret the change, but financially it’s tighter.\n Here’s what’s weighing on me:\n •I can’t sell the property without taking a loss.\n •If I move into it after the tenant’s lease ends, I’ll be paying RM3.5k out of RM8.3k (~42% of my income) just for mortgage + maintenance. That doesn’t include utilities, furnishing, minor renovations, or general living costs.\n Technically, I can afford it. But it would feel tight. I wouldn’t have much buffer for saving or investing, and that makes me uneasy.\n At the same time, I’m 39 and still living with my parents. They’re not forcing me out, and we’re on good terms. But emotionally, I feel… stalled. I want my own space. I want autonomy. I want to feel like I’m building my life, not just optimizing spreadsheets.\n To make moving out workable, I’m considering refinancing from 25 years to 30 years to lower the monthly instalment.\n Financially, I know it means paying more interest long term. Emotionally, it might buy me independence and breathing room.\n I guess my real question is: Is it foolish to stretch a loan tenure for lifestyle reasons? Or is this one of those times where optimizing for quality of life is valid?\n Would really appreciate perspectives, especially from anyone who’s navigated property decisions after a career/income shift.\n    submitted by    /u/Atlantis_Peridot  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I see alot of you DCA into it which I think means putting abit abit each month since it's safer incase you invested during a bad time.\n Should I still do this?

          "description": "Hi guys, need some advice.. parents are getting to that age when they want to settle their inheritance issue. Our thought is, rather than splitting up assets and giving this sibling this or that to individually manage, it would be better financially to put everything in a trust or a company and have all sibling manage/share it equally. The basic thinking is that we can do more when we pool our assets all together. From what I’ve read online there are some pros to doing this, protection of assets in case of bankruptcy, and more structured financial planning for future generations..\n I’ve briefly talked to some people (relatives who are in a related field) and so far the initial reaction I get is not to do it because it usually causes rifts in the family but when I dig deeper the cause of that is usually because nobody discusses or agrees to exit terms beforehand.\n So, leaving out family dynamics, just wanted some input on whether it financially makes sense and if so what are technical ways to do this?

          "description": "Serious question, not trying to start drama.\n I understand Ramadan is an important and meaningful month for Muslims here. But I’ve always wondered why the reaction toward people eating in public during fasting hours can sometimes be so intense.\n Malaysia isn’t 100% Muslim, and even among Muslims there are valid reasons not to fast like health issues, menstruation, pregnancy, travel, etc. From the outside, we don’t actually know about people’s situation.\n What confuses me more is that sometimes the response goes beyond just disapproval. There have been cases where people were questioned or detained by religious authorities for eating publicly during Ramadan. That makes it feel like it’s treated almost like as a serious public offense even though the person might simply just be non-Muslim or someone with a valid exemption.\n So, what I’m genuinely trying to understand is why does this issue trigger such strong emotional and institutional reactions?\n Is it about public respect? Community identity? Social pressure? Something else?\n I’m asking because I want to understand the social reasoning behind it, not to attack anyone’s beliefs.\n    submitted by    /u/BankRepulsive8070  \n [link]   [comments]",

Pretty sure not. Apparently for Chinese and Indian cultures single people don't give out money packet during CNY or Thaipusam.\n And I suddenly had a thought.\n Why have I been doing this? I thought it's a nice thing to share a bit I have to the kids.\n But some of the adults comments are nasty. \"Just RM3/RM5? So kedekut\". I only give RM20-RM50 to my younger siblings or kid…",

Around my place in Jalan Kuching, it feels like the whole area is transforming into a full-blown metropolis. There’s an MRT station being built nearby, plus more hotels and high-rise residences.\n What honestly bothers me isn’t development itself, I understand cities grow. It’s more about how much greenery we’re losing in the process. It used to be a place filled with trees and nature. When I played futsal, I could actually hear birds in the background. Soon, I’ll probably just hear the train passing by.\n Another thing I don’t quite understand is the planning. Companies seems to be launching condo projects everywhere, yet the roads and traffic conditions don’t seem to improve at the same pace. And regarding the new MRT station, we already have two MRT stations about 10–15 minutes away. Wouldn’t it make more sense to improve bus connectivity to those existing stations instead of building another one so close?\n I’m not against progress, but I do wonder if we’re balancing development, infrastructure, and quality of life properly.\n Just sharing some thoughts curious to hear what you guys think.\n    submitted by    /u/GymsharkSingh  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone! I’ll be relocating to Malaysia soon with my family for work. My office will be in Bandar Bukit Raja, and I’m considering living in one of these areas:\n • Damansara Heights\n • Mont Kiara\n • Desa ParkCity\n I know Klang Valley traffic can be intense, but I’m trying to understand what a realistic daily commute looks like. I need to be at the office by 8:30 AM.\n When I check Google Maps for public transport, it tells me I’d need to leave 9 hours earlier, which I’m assuming is because it doesn’t know the actual bus/train options for that route. My prefer option would be by car, but I’m not sure if the 40 minutes is realistic\n For those who live in these areas or commute toward Klang/Bukit Raja:\n • How long would the drive take if I leave around 7:45 :\n • Is public transport even a viable option I\n for this route\n • Any tips on the best roads or timing to avoid the worst jams\n Thanks in advance , any local insight would really help me plan!\n    submitted by    /u/Ecstatic-Relative-90  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unfortunately, I have to rehome her, and I'm desperately seeking helpful advice on how to make this process easier for both her and myself.\n I've been planning to immigrate to Australia from Malaysia for a few months now. While I'm excited about this new chapter in my life, I am also heartbroken that I need to rehome my cat. I can't take her with me due to the strict pet relocation rules in Australia, and Malaysia is not an approved country for relocating pets. Even if it was, I wouldn't have the financial means to cover the expenses.\n Has anyone here gone through a similar situation? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/Zestyclose_Pool_5604  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I’m from Sarawak, and I would like to respectfully seek guidance regarding a family heirloom . It is an old Iban Kain Kumbu textile that has been passed down through approximately 4–5 generations in my family.... l am not sure but would like to ask an expert about this!!\n Family lineage timeline:\n • My late great-great grandmother • Passed down to my late great grandmother • Then to my grandmother • Then to my mother • Now in my possession \n According to my mother’s oral history, this textile was worn by an ancestor named Niang Inik Kantan. The longhouse origin is unfortunately unknown as most elders in our family have passed away sadly no information was to further explaining more about this Kain Kumbu\n The piece appears:\n • Handwoven • Naturally dyed (earth tones, deep browns, muted red/blue) • Smaller in size compared to modern 1970s–1990s Kain Kumbu • In good structural condition • Has a natural woody scent consistent with aged textile storage \n I am genuinely seeking:\n 1. Advice on authentication. 2. How to verify age (pre-1900? 1800s?). 3. Whether museum textile experts in Sarawak or Malaysia would be appropriate to consult. 4. General historical context of early Kain Kumbu weaving. \n I deeply respect its cultural and spiritual value, and I want to approach this carefully and correctly. Because this is from our family heirloom and been on generations...\n Any guidance from historians, textile experts, collectors, or museum professionals would be sincerely appreciated.\n Thank you.\n Comparison size to the modern one on second photo..\n    submitted by    /u/Future_Discipline184  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am 25 and I have no clue about finances. I try to save as much as possible and tbh money/financial things overwhelm me to the point I avoid looking into things too much. One of my coworkers did recommend me to Ameriprise and the advisor there wanted to open a brokerage account and do all sorts of stuff. Frankly, that whole conversation was a lot and I still haven’t said yes to it. So I am posting here to push me to learn about finances. Here is a quick background of my finances: making 84k in Texas, do 8% to my 401k for company match of 6%. I have a HSA and started to contribute $40 bucks every paycheck so $80 monthly. I have roughly $54k in savings, $19k in checking , and a Roth IRA with 6k invested and 3k not yet invested. My take home pay after taxes and insurances is $4700, minus rent/card is $2,300. I have no debt but right now I live with my mom and brother and take care of most of our bills due to my mom loosing her job. Within the next year, my goal is to purchase a house and move out but still plan to contribute some towards my mom. So should I max out my Roth IRA for this year since I still have time to contribute? Is Fidelity Go worth it while I figure stuff out ? Should I just invest in one stock like S&P500 or multiple ? How does HSA investing work? Is it the same as a ROTH ? \n    submitted by    /u/No-Judgment2792  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Background: Single mother. Got laid off from my teaching position last year and only found part time work as a tutor this year. Then my child’s father passed away so I lost child support (getting survivor benefits now, but it still set me back). I nearly lost my car to repossession, nearly lost auto insurance, and I’m 2-4 payments behind on all of my credit cards. No savings.\n Current: With my daughter’s SS payments, our rent and groceries should be paid for going forward. But I’m still behind on everything else except the car and barely in the black. Because I went from full time to part time, I got a huge amount back on my tax refund. Over $10k. I first paid back family I had borrow money from these past few months, so that was around $3k. I have about 7k left to set myself up for success here. I’ll save $1k for an emergency fund, so that’s $6k left.\n Hopefully I will find a full time job next year, but this summer I won’t have a consistent income at all (unless I get a summer school position, which I have applied for).\n Question: I have about $10k in high interest credit card debt spread across four cards. My worst one is $5k. $200 monthly payment. 29% interest. Currently four months behind but started a payment plan. Obviously I could just pay that entire amount off now.\n But I also have a shitty 2014 Kia Soul with $4k left to pay it off. It costs me $220 a month in car payments at 12% interest, plus $200 in full coverage insurance. Part of me wants to pay this off first because when I get behind they threaten to repossess it, and I would be so fucked if that happened. I think I’d also reduce my insurance coverage to save money there.\n Obviously the credit card has a higher interest rate, but paying off the car would give me more security over the next few months until I (hopefully) find full time work.\n Then again, I could pay off the card first, and apply that extra $200 to my car to pay it off faster but not if I can’t find steady summer work.\n    submitted by    /u/ThrowRAhedgehog24  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all. I have a decent job currently making 75k USD a year. I’m from Canada but currently work in the US. I have a masters degree and about 3 years out into the industry from when I graduated. I have 2 roommates which brings the cost of rent down significantly. However I live in a city with a very high COL (nyc). Additionally, I have a significant student loan debt of $77k CAD. Thankfully in Canada this has no interest, but I will be paying $420 CAD (~$310 USD) monthly for the next 14 years (started paying last year).\n That being said, I currently don’t have any savings, 401k, or any investments (stocks, etc.). I need help but don’t know where to start. I have some credit card debt but very insignificant, so really it’s just the student loans. I do not own a car as I live in nyc. I’m currently taking my licensure exams (I’m in the architecture field) and I have 2/4 more to go and once I get licensed I will have more opportunities for higher positions with significantly better pay. I think I’m on an okay path but I’m anxious about not having any savings.\n What can I do? Where do I start? I never learned anything about money growing up so you can say I am pretty financially illiterate, and I have made some mistakes I in terms of living above my means and partying a lot during my 20s, but I have adjusted my lifestyle since (moved to a cheaper apartment with roommates, limit going out, cooking at home vs eating out & delivery)\n Thank you in advance\n    submitted by    /u/Sad_Argument3699  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now I’m suddenly ready to start taking it all seriously.\n I’ve started two of my goals already. One being putting $50 into my Roth IRA account each week along with buying $50 of stock every-time I want To buy something useless, and the other being starting to put $400 a week towards my car payment to be debt free by Christmas. (I don’t pay rent with family but want to simulate somewhat of what it would be like to have to have a $1600 a month expense.\n This being said, another item I want to start with is saving smartly.

It’s not millions or anything, but it’s a good amount and honestly I have no idea what to do with it besides maybe saving it for a rainy day or putting it in a high-yield savings account.\n I was really happy when I found out, but I also feel like I can’t tell anyone in real life because last time I had money, people started asking me for help and I ended up broke. When I turned 18 something similar happened and within a year I gave a lot away to family and spent a lot partying with friends. I always told myself if I ever got another chance, I’d do better.\n Right now I’ve managed to save about $10k on my own (mostly through Acorns), and this payout will add about another $20k. I do have around $40k in student loan debt and I’m going back to school soon.\n Part of me wants to just disappear, save it, maybe travel a little and keep the rest safe… but I really don’t trust my own money decisions yet.\n Funny enough, before this happened I kept telling myself I was already rich in spirit and doing a lot of “money manifestation” mindset work. My goal this year was to reach $100k net worth and this payout basically got me about 30% of the way there, which makes me really happy. At the same time, it kind of sucks because I feel like I can’t really tell anyone in my real life without it turning into people asking me for money.\n If you were in my situation, what would you do first?\n Serious advice only please :)\n TLDR: Accident → payout → suddenly responsible adult with ~$30k and no clue what to do.

          "description": "Hey everyone, looking for budgeting/debt advice. plz don't judge the interest rate on the car, I already know it wasn't the smartest choice, would rather not be grilled for something I already grilled myself over.\n I’m 22 and active duty Navy. Total debt is around $28k:\n  \n~$16k student loans (currently in deferment)\n ~$9k car loan (very high interest rate (~29%), credit score ~560)\n ~$950 Discover (charged off ~2 years ago)\n ~$2,100 personal loan (charged off ~2 years ago)\n $300 unsecured credit card (paid in full monthly)\n  \nI’m about to receive a $30k bonus. My plan is to immediately pay off the $9k car loan because the interest rate is crazy high. That would leave me with about $21k.\n Monthly situation:\n  \nTake home: ~$2,500 (after 10% to TSP)\n Save: ~$400/month (Factored in take home pay)\n Car insurance: $200/month\n Subscriptions: <$60/month\n No rent\n  \nMain questions:\n  \nAfter paying off the car, should I wipe out the student loans? I'd rather just pay them off monthly instead of 16k all upfront especially as there's no large impact and I'll be making significantly more money in two years from now when they are no longer deferred\n Should I try to settle the two charged-off accounts even though I haven’t heard anything in years?\n Or is it smarter to build a large emergency fund first?\n What would help my credit score the most over the next 1–2 years?\n  \nGoals are to clean this up, improve my credit, and set myself up to buy a house in a few years. I know I made mistakes early on — just trying to make a smart move with this bonus instead of blowing it.\n Appreciate any advice.\n Edit: First and foremost thanks you to everyone who commented and reviewed my post!! I feel pretty confident now that I can make an informed decision going forward!!\n    submitted by    /u/maximusprime0122  \n [link]   [comments]",

Last week, I received my inheritance of about 150k (they both had very large life insurance policies through the military). \n I truly don't know what to do with this and I don't have any family to ask for help. I'm only 22 and a first year teacher.\n For more context, I don't have any student loans (I worked my way through university), and I paid off my car 3 months ago. So, I don't have any debt. I live modestly in a small 1 bedroom apartment. My budget is tight, but not unmanageable. \n I've never had this kind of money before and don't know what to do next. I grew up very poor and never received any financial education. The check has just been sitting in its envelope since I got it. Honestly, having the money just feels really shitty and the grief makes it hard to think about clearly.\n I want to put it somewhere it can grow and I still have access to liquidate, I'm just unsure of what that would be.

By the end of the month, I’m left wondering if I actually saved anything at all.\n I try to plan ahead, but unexpected expenses always come up — a sick child, home repairs, or even just a small “fun” treat for my little one. It makes me realize that being a parent isn’t just about earning money; it’s about constantly balancing priorities while thinking long-term.\n Does anyone else feel like no matter how careful you budget, something unexpected happens and wipes out your savings?

          "description": "My spouse and I co-own a house in a high-tax area (NY) with a sibling. It was my spouse’s childhood home, so there is significant emotional attachment.\n The house is currently rented and roughly covers the existing mortgage. Estimated value is $450k and still owe 85k on mortgage.\n However: • It needs approximately $50k in major, non-cosmetic repairs in the near term (roof, septic, furnace, oil tank). • The home has not had cosmetic updates in ~30 years. • It’s in a high property tax area.\n The sibling would like to be bought out. If we do that, we would need to refinance and take on a new loan. At current rates, the property would likely not fully cash flow. Rent would be close but would not cover principal + interest + taxes + insurance, especially once factoring in upcoming repairs.\n Additional context: • Our personal finances are not in strong shape. • We are carrying debt. • Our credit is not strong. • We are not being approved for favorable traditional loan terms. • We do not have sufficient reserves to comfortably absorb $50k in repairs. • We have young kids and other financial obligations.\n From a purely financial standpoint, selling and splitting proceeds would likely strengthen our situation and reduce risk.\n However, emotionally this is my spouse’s childhood home, and selling it feels like closing a chapter for him.\n My question isn’t just “does this cash flow?” I know the numbers are tight. It’s: how do couples responsibly weigh deep sentimental attachment against financial fragility?\n Is it ever reasonable to carry a property that doesn’t cash flow and needs major capital work if finances are already stretched? Or is that simply too much risk regardless of emotional value?\n Looking for perspective from people who’ve navigated similar decisions.\n    submitted by    /u/lurkingharriet  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've known about this for around 5 years, so it isn't unexpected. Despite this, the anxiety surrounding the lump sum is still overwhelming. I have read through this subreddit's wiki and some other advice, but I want more targeted information, and to be completely honest a lot of the information is flying over my head as I'm not financially literate/savvy.\n Here are some things I plan to do in the future: - 2 years of community college (free) --> transfer 2 years state school - Open a Roth IRA and put maximum contributions into it - Put a sum of money into a HYSA - Making diversified investments with a portion of the money (ie. ETFs, bonds, mutual funds) - Likely to be living with my mom for the next 4 years to maximize savings & help with mortgage - Discuss my situation to a non-commissioned financial advisor - Don't touch any of the lump sum unless absolutely necessary\n My mom is also urging me to not use a credit card as I can likely pay most things off with cash, but I don't know if that's the best option. I'll likely only open one credit card and make monthly subscription payments with it, paying it off immediately. I think it's a good fallback in case anything goes wrong, but I'm not an expert in credit and only have knowledge that's scraping the surface.\n Essentially, I would like to know if there are any glaring problems I should be considering in my future financial plan.

My dad then walked out on all of us, leaving my mom to go back to school to get her degree and teaching credentials so she could teach Special Education. So she finally has been working in special education at a Charter school (not public) for the last 5 years. (Note - my mother found out years later they weren’t legally married - she found out at city hall when she went to file divorce papers)\n Finances: Because she was a stay at home mom for so long, we are assuming her SS is going to be fairly small. Additionally, she only started a 401k a few years back but only about $5k in it. Thankfully she has no debt.\n Question: How should I help her to plan for any kind of retirement? At this point is maxing out her 401k her best option? Her employer doesn’t match - so should we skip 401k and put it into straight into an IRA?

          "description": "Hi everyone, I am in need of a new vehicle and need help deciding what to do. I have a 2011 Hyundai that has slowly become a money pit. I bought the car in 2021 and after thousands in repairs, new problems continue to come up and I've decided I am done with it. I am 27 and I have only ever bought older used cars in cash.\n I started looking for another vehicle and have test driven a bunch of cars and I have not been happy with any of them. I planned on using ~15k cash to get a used car, nothing special but I am hoping for something with known reliability (Honda or Toyota). But so far every car I've looked at in this range is just not worth the money, high miles, lots of cosmetic damage, or obvious mechanical issues. I even stretched to look at cars closer to 20k and seeing many cars in that price range with over 100k miles and the condition some were in was ridiculous to me. \n So I learned that it appears the used car market has had quite the shift and used car prices have exploded. So for the first time ever I am considering buying a new car instead of saving $5-10k to buy a used car that I'll have to replace much sooner. I am looking at the 2026 base model Civic which is around $26k. I currently make $67k (~$4500 net/mo) with no debt other than a cheap mortgage and my monthly expenses including \"extra/fun\" money comes out to about $2000. On a rough estimate, I believe close to 15k down and hopefully a bit of trade in value, it looks like I might be looking at a $250-300 payment for 60 months. \n Considering I hope to keep the car for 10+ years, is this a good idea? Or a completely horrible idea and I should keep looking for a used car? \n    submitted by    /u/wonder-egg  \n [link]   [comments]",

The university advertises that students who take x or more credits (which I qualfiied for) \"do not pay copays or coinsurance for provider visits at [name]! \" . I also asked the front-desk if/how much would be billed to insurance, and they said that it should be covered for students. It turned out to be the flu, and the only thing that the medical staff member did was give me a flu and covid test. The next day, I am completely fine and recover on my own after the week-ish of abnormal shivers and sickness. I would have never went to the student care if they provided price transparency instead of deceiving students.\n I then get a bill for ~$400, and although insurance adjusted it by a bit, it's still $300. It's not covered by insurance because my insurance has a high deductible.\n I have heard that you can negotiate even if you have insurance, so long as you are willing to pay immediately. If they bring the bill down to a REASONABLE amount ($100-150), I would be able to pay immediately.\n Can someone please provide me with some tips to negotiate this urgent care visit given the circumstances of me being a student (I still am a student) and it being health services provided by the university?\n    submitted by    /u/Dramatic_Fly6177  \n [link]   [comments]",

My “main“ job is a part time job at a grocery store, which has been cutting my hours and the store director gets in a mood whenever we stay over so more often than not it’s not an option. They never promote any full time workers, so getting full time is extremely unlikely. I told myself I either need to find a better job or a second job.\n So far the only other place to have contacted me back and hire me is another grocery store. I’ll be working morning and mid shifts at the first one, closing at the second.\n Issue is, the hours of my first job fluctuate— I can be working less then 20 hours for months, but then suddenly be working over 30 hours, six days a week, the next couple weeks. Which means I can be working 50+ hours some weeks with two jobs. I also have my benefits and paid vacations at the first job that I’m reluctant to lose right away and start over at another job.\n However, I need the finances. I’m in student loan debt, have to pay for my own groceries, am trying to move out of a toxic household, and would need to eventually pay for other expenses later on. Working at my inconsistent first job alone isn’t enough anymore if I’m going to survive off only $200 each week on my low weeks.\n I am worried about burn out, though, and the lack of a social life and time to myself. Since my off days are inconsistent at both jobs, I can’t guarantee any days off unless I request off (and since I’m opening at the one, closing at the other, my whole day will be booked). I am going to see how it goes and if I can’t handle it, I’ll quit one of the jobs. I’ll also continue looking for better jobs and side hustles in the meantime. \n But I just wanted to ask if it’s worth doing two jobs in my circumstances? I know the answer seems obvious. But I’m just worried about burn out. At the very least, any tips on how to endure and not feel so burn out?\n    submitted by    /u/TheCrazyOutcast  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I called to cancel, the retention agent had the gall to insinuate it was my fault for not calling earlier to complain. apparently, loyalty for nearly a decade and no claims filed isn't enough to get a low rate. \n tl;dr - if you haven't checked your insurance rates lately, do it. They might be boiling you like the proverbial frog. I don't know if all companies do this, but screw Liberty Mutual. Oh, and your commercials are annoying.\n    submitted by    /u/totalDerphammer  \n [link]   [comments]",

Got nailed by taxes pretty hard ($6k), and I'm looking at how to plan moving forward outside of memorizing the tax code for my state lol.\n My original plan was to set up a sinking fund to cover moving out expenses (10%) and put 15% into the Rath. However that plan needs to be put on pause for obvious reasons. Now I could dip into my efund and simply adjust said plan, with the 15% going into rebuilding it and the 10% going into the IRA, but while these taxes are definitely scary, I think I can pay them off with monthly payments and by filing an extension. I had no issues paying them off last year, so I don't have a negative reputation with the IRS. That and the last thing I need is to pay off taxes only for an actual emergency to happen.\n What do yall think? Is this a sound approach to dealing with these expenses? Would you deem taxes a suitable emergency? Should I drop everything (including the Rath) to pay these off (Baby Step 2)?

          "description": "I know the topic of including international stocks has come up a few times this week, but I finally made the change. A few years ago I read The Simple Path to Wealth and started following it's principles, not perfectly, but as well as I could in my situation with a young family. I have been watching VXUS over the past year due to seeing an interview with J.L. where he mentioned that he would tell his daughter to watch out for international stocks starting to outperform U.S. stocks due to changes in the global economy. When I saw his blog post this month, I decided to include international stocks as well and I intend to be invested in them long term. \n I saw another post here that recommended moving all stocks to VT for it's simplicity and just let it ride. However, isn't cost also a major factor? I wanted to keep an eye on costs and implement this in the most cost effective way possible. What I did is take a portion from VTI and move it to VXUS, which will give me a better expense ratio and have very similar performance as just holding VT. VT has an expense ratio of .06%, VXUS is .05%, and VTI is .03%. So, for example, if I have a total of $10,000 invested with approximately $6,000 in VTI and $4,000 (about 60% U.S. and 40% international) I'm only paying .03% for the bulk of my stock portfolio and .05% for the international component instead of .06% to hold everything in one fund. It's easy for me to rebalance to keep about the same ratios as VT as well because I add to the fund throughout the year and can add a little more to VTI or more to VXUS to keep in line with VT. What are some of the arguments against this approach? Is it just for simplicity and not tinkering with your investments?\n    submitted by    /u/RandomThings365  \n [link]   [comments]",

Metros being built, community filling up, 3 malls, a city dedicated to students right above it, new etihad rail, etc... huge developments. price was 548k aed which is 149k usd give or take. now, the studio is 319 sqft and its projected to get done in q3 2028. Current rent there is 45k aed a year (12250 usd/year). \n The eay its going with inflation and general uptrend of studio rent prices/the upgrades to the area I mentioned earlier everyone is predicting rent to be 55k aed a year (roughly 15k usd) so the roi seems good. \n payment plan is 20% upfront and 1500 usd a month until completion which will be 50% of the property then after that ill have 20% more saved up meaning ill have to get mortgage for the other 30% (probably going to end hp being a 3 year mortgage on 4% fee). \n All that said, im 35 and have a small family. This is my introduction to the real estate investment side of things. Was this a smart decision or a bad one?\n    submitted by    /u/RNGH2  \n [link]   [comments]",

I found one that has decent rewards for travel and dining, so I applied.\n Credit score: 798\n Total unused credit: 72k\n Current balance across all cards: $3200\n Gross Annual income (combined with wife): 312k\n I got approved and they extended me a $5.1k credit line. This is far lower than my current card. Im just confused about why it would be so low.\n I spoke with a coworker and he said its probably because credit companies want me to carry a balance and they dont want someone who pays it off in full every month.

          "description": "I've spent a few hours trying to wrap my head around why people online (see here) are often adamant that a traditional 401(k) and Roth IRA is the way to go - especially with how high the praise is for the latter - yet I don't often see people talking about doing both a Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA. If the Roth IRA is so great, why wouldn't you want to also do a Roth 401(k)? It seems like they adhere to the same taxation rules, so is there something substantially different about Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA accounts that make them fundamentally different animals that I'm just not aware of? Maybe it's simply for diversification? The only real difference I've heard is that Roth IRAs typically allow for more aggressive investment options and the ability to withdraw contributions easier, but that's about it.\n My job allows me to contribute to a traditional and/or Roth 401(k) with a match up to 4% - my understanding is if I were to switch to a Roth percentage, their match would still go to a traditional, pre-tax account instead - and I'm currently maxing it out on the traditional side while maxing a separate Roth IRA. I'm not uncomfortable with that arrangement, but it still irks me not understanding what makes a Roth 401(k) \"bad\" but a Roth IRA \"good\" in the eyes of a lot of people (I know it's largely subjective and relative to individuals' goals, but you know what I mean), when they're like... the same thing as far as I can tell.\n Thanks in advance for any information.\n    submitted by    /u/spongebobstyle  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Don't get an expensive master's degree unless you truly need it for career advancement (i.e., you have a very concrete and realistic plan of how you will pay for it). \n I am a teacher at a private boarding school in Massachusetts. A lot of my colleagues found themselves in the workforce for a few years, usually as teachers, then decided that their life felt stagnant and got a master's degree from places like Columbia or whatever. They figured it was a logical next move as a typical \"striver\" who wants to achieve the next milestone in life, assuming it would lead to new opportunities. Underrated fact: even at places like Harvard, many of these master's degrees are not particularly selective and will enroll almost any baseline smart/competent person - they're a cash cow for the university primarily used to fund their PhD programs! \n Anyways, these people end up in serious debt and forego earnings while getting the degrees, sometimes in excess of $100,000. And what did they do with their degree? They went back to teaching - basically the exact same job they already had with the same earning potential. \n I'm curious if this is a pattern in other lines of work - do any of your coworkers also randomly get masters degree at enormous expense that they don't put to good use? In my opinion you should only go to graduate school for a profession that truly requires the credential (JD, MD, etc), or if you get it funded (via a PhD program or through your employer).\n    submitted by    /u/NotAGoldenRetriever  \n [link]   [comments]",
