        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I (19M) plan on buying my first car before summer. My parents are going to pitch in about 1-2k. Me and my dad have been looking at auctions for a car thats not too old. 
 I’ve been driving for 3 years but it has been my parents car that they never really used. But now that im in college I want my own set of wheels.
 My dad says I should find a cheap car around 4-5k and finance it to also build some credit since I don’t yet have a score.

Searches are expected to continue today at Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s previous home – Royal Lodge, in Windsor – as calls grow for a probe into the former prince’s links with Jeffrey Epstein.
Lucy Hough speaks to the Guardian’s police and crime correspondent, Vikram Dodd, about what could be next for Andrew here:
If the government bring forward this bill with the support of the King then we will back it. We have to be realistic. Andrew is the eighth in line to the throne, so there’s no chance of him becoming our monarch.
And so parliament really should be focused on things that are of more importance to the public, whether that’s the economy, crime, the health service, immigration. But if the bill does come before parliament, then we’ll support it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im in the planning/estimating phase of a new home build. 
 So here's the situation. I already own the land and there is a house on the lot. We live in it but it needs everything. Roof, mold mitigation, every wall is plaster, subfloor are warped, electric and plumbing are shot, hvac is not installed right, every window and door is clapped, foundation is crumbling, Ghosts ect.
 I could throw 200k at it and we would still have problems. Zillow estimate puts us at 350k but houses around here sell for like 600k+ and we're in a primo spot so tbd on what we will appraise at.
 The house sits on a 5 acer plot and I want to build a new house next to it and demo the old one. 
 I have a background in engineering and I manage contractors for a living so I want to be my own GC. The house will be a barndo. I have quotes for the kit, construction, site work and ill bid out the other trades when we're ready for rough in work once all the framing is done.
 Question is should I take out a construction loan? I was looking into FFBKC since they let you be your own GC and lend for the barndo concept 
 Or should I take out a HELOC and borrow what's needed. Or cash out refinance and use the money from that.
 I have about 100k cash for this venture and no debt. I make 145k annually.

Mom is a stay at home housewife so she usually cooks me lunch for me to bawak bekal to office. Same goes for dinner, as she cooks for the whole family.
 I am also naturally frugal and dont spend much on clothes or outing. No financial commitment as well. No girlfriend, car, or any student loan. I also commute to work by public transport everyday. So technically I only spend about RM200 out of my pocket every month for Netflix, PS+, late night kopitiam etc. This means I save RM4k/month on the regular after deducting all my expenses.

The mother of a student who was killed in the 2023 Nottingham attacks has said she will “fight to the bitter end” to get to the truth of how Valdo Calocane was free to attack, before the beginning of a public inquiry into the incident.
Barnaby Webber and Grace O’Malley-Kumar, 19-year-old students, and 65-year-old caretaker Ian Coates were fatally stabbed by Calocane on 13 June 2023 in a frenzied attack. Early the next day, Calocane drove a van into pedestrians Wayne Birkett, Sharon Miller and Marcin Gawronski, leaving all three with severe and life-changing injuries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I got into a dispute with ATT because they of a trade in. I turned in my phone to upgrade to an s25 and they said it would cover the bill of the s25. After six months I was still being billed the full price. After several calls they said they never got it. I called the store and they said they don’t have records dating back six months. I recorded all these conversations. I got in touch with someone from their “office of the president” who played phone tag with me for a week and then claimed the matter was resolved in an email. 
 I got sick of it and went to Verizon. ATT sent me a bill for 800. They charged my credit card which I disputed because I did nott consent to that charge. I logged in to my att portal and it shows I have a negative balance of $765. 
 What is the best course of action here?

Although the US president often spends weekends at the ocean resort, he was at the White House in Washington during this incident, as was first lady Melania Trump.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I currently hold over $10k in a HYSA. My living expenses are roughly $1k-1.5k a month (renting from friend's parent) and I make on average $3.2k a month (Contract work). Got nailed by taxes pretty hard ($6k), and I'm looking at how to plan moving forward outside of memorizing the tax code for my state lol.
 My original plan was to set up a sinking fund to cover moving out expenses (10%) and put 15% into the Rath. However that plan needs to be put on pause for obvious reasons. Now I could dip into my efund and simply adjust said plan, with the 15% going into rebuilding it and the 10% going into the IRA, but while these taxes are definitely scary, I think I can pay them off with monthly payments and by filing an extension. I had no issues paying them off last year, so I don't have a negative reputation with the IRS. That and the last thing I need is to pay off taxes only for an actual emergency to happen.
 What do yall think? Is this a sound approach to dealing with these expenses? Would you deem taxes a suitable emergency? Should I drop everything (including the Rath) to pay these off (Baby Step 2)? Would love your feedback.
 If I don't respond immediately, I'm on the way home. Thanks everyone!

Graeme Wearden: Trump’s trade war risks undermining his hopes of hefty US interest rate cuts

High-level talks with the US administration over the threat of increased tariffs are under way as the UK government says it wants “the best possible deal” for UK companies.
Business leaders said they expected the UK to “double down” on the existing Economic Prosperity Deal (EPD) – announced by Donald Trump and Keir Starmer in May last year – rather than walk away.

 If I take money from a IRA for a down payment on a new home, I have to repay the IRA within 60 days or incur a $50,000. tax hit. I think that’s too risky. 
 I spoke to a lender who recommended the following: I believe the best option for P would be obtaining a new mortgage, using her retirement funds for the down payment, & adding a recast option to her mortgage.

 According to my mother’s oral history, this textile was worn by an ancestor named Niang Inik Kantan. The longhouse origin is unfortunately unknown as most elders in our family have passed away sadly no information was to further explaining more about this Kain Kumbu
 The piece appears:
 • Handwoven • Naturally dyed (earth tones, deep browns, muted red/blue) • Smaller in size compared to modern 1970s–1990s Kain Kumbu • In good structural condition • Has a natural woody scent consistent with aged textile storage 
 I am genuinely seeking:
 1. Advice on authentication. 2. How to verify age (pre-1900? 1800s?). 3. Whether museum textile experts in Sarawak or Malaysia would be appropriate to consult. 4. General historical context of early Kain Kumbu weaving. 
 I deeply respect its cultural and spiritual value, and I want to approach this carefully and correctly. Because this is from our family heirloom and been on generations...
 Any guidance from historians, textile experts, collectors, or museum professionals would be sincerely appreciated.
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know the topic of including international stocks has come up a few times this week, but I finally made the change. A few years ago I read The Simple Path to Wealth and started following it's principles, not perfectly, but as well as I could in my situation with a young family. I have been watching VXUS over the past year due to seeing an interview with J.L. where he mentioned that he would tell his daughter to watch out for international stocks starting to outperform U.S. stocks due to changes in the global economy. When I saw his blog post this month, I decided to include international stocks as well and I intend to be invested in them long term. 
 I saw another post here that recommended moving all stocks to VT for it's simplicity and just let it ride. However, isn't cost also a major factor? I wanted to keep an eye on costs and implement this in the most cost effective way possible. What I did is take a portion from VTI and move it to VXUS, which will give me a better expense ratio and have very similar performance as just holding VT. VT has an expense ratio of .06%, VXUS is .05%, and VTI is .03%. So, for example, if I have a total of $10,000 invested with approximately $6,000 in VTI and $4,000 (about 60% U.S. and 40% international) I'm only paying .03% for the bulk of my stock portfolio and .05% for the international component instead of .06% to hold everything in one fund. It's easy for me to rebalance to keep about the same ratios as VT as well because I add to the fund throughout the year and can add a little more to VTI or more to VXUS to keep in line with VT. What are some of the arguments against this approach? Is it just for simplicity and not tinkering with your investments?

Donald Trump has told Netflix to remove the Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice from its board or “face the consequences”, while the streaming platform is locked in an extraordinary corporate battle to take control of Warner Bros Discovery (WBD).
In comments posted on his Truth Social platform, the US president described Rice – who served as national security adviser to Barack Obama and UN ambassador and White House adviser under Joe Biden – as a “political hack” and accused her of having “no talent or skills”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought a car almost 2 months ago from a CDJR dealer in MI
 Paid deposit, signed, took truck home. When time came to pay, we hadn’t received any information on the bank yet. We called the dealer and they had us come back in since they worked a better deal out with the same bank- cool whatever better deal
 Now apparently our payment is due tomorrow, but nothing is finalized at the bank STILL.
 Our temp tag expires tomorrow as well. Not too sure what to do or go around this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last summer my father made a poor choice when he needed a new roof - he went through Erie Roofing, financed through Goodleap, and paid probably twice as much as he should have. He passed away unexpectedly a few weeks ago and we don’t know what to do about the loan. He was the only name on the loan, we have no estate because he didn’t have many assets or money. Nearly all of his bank accounts had me listed in trust and the house is in his and my mother’s name (she is still with us.) my mother is on Social Security and it may not be enough for her to live off of and keep the home, although we are going to try, but the loan will make it nearly impossible. I hate the idea of not paying a debt, but is there any option that allows us to have the loan forgiven due to his death?
 Also - the salesman for Erie specifically told my parents that if he were to die the loan would not have to be repaid, I feel like that was a predatory move on his part and not fully accurate.

Fewer than one in 10 boys aged 14 to 16 in the UK read daily, according to research, which found reading for pleasure was being crowded out of teenage lives by schoolwork, screens and sports.
While reading declines for both boys and girls in early adolescence, there are “signs of recovery” among girls in later teenage years, but boys’ engagement remains persistently low, according to the National Literacy Trust (NLT).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Guardian analysis finds the vast majority of people who entered deportation proceedings for the first time from January to August last year had no criminal convictions
A Guardian analysis of government records has found that the vast majority – 77% – of people who entered deportation proceedings for the first time in 2025 had no criminal conviction, exposing a stark gap between the Trump administration’s rhetoric and reality.
Within days of Donald Trump’s inauguration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) trotted out a phrase that his surrogates would come to use over and over again: “the worst of the worst.”
Fewer than half of the people in the data (40%) had any criminal charge against them, and only 23% had a conviction.
Of those who did have a criminal conviction, nearly half were for non-violent traffic and immigration offenses.
Traffic offenses alone made up nearly 30% of the convictions, the largest category by far.

Scotland Yard is using AI tools supplied by the US tech company Palantir to monitor staff behaviour in an attempt to root out failing officers, the Guardian has learned.
The Metropolitan police has previously declined to confirm or deny whether it used technology supplied by the company, which also works for the Israeli military and Donald Trump’s ICE operation. It has now confirmed that it is using Palantir’s AI to analyse internal data about sickness levels, absences from duty and overtime patterns in an effort to identify potential shortcomings in professional standards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently bought an off plan studio apartment in Dubai. specifically Dubailand Residence Complex. There are goijg to be major changes and upgrades to the area by 2030. Metros being built, community filling up, 3 malls, a city dedicated to students right above it, new etihad rail, etc... huge developments. price was 548k aed which is 149k usd give or take. now, the studio is 319 sqft and its projected to get done in q3 2028. Current rent there is 45k aed a year (12250 usd/year). 
 The eay its going with inflation and general uptrend of studio rent prices/the upgrades to the area I mentioned earlier everyone is predicting rent to be 55k aed a year (roughly 15k usd) so the roi seems good. 
 payment plan is 20% upfront and 1500 usd a month until completion which will be 50% of the property then after that ill have 20% more saved up meaning ill have to get mortgage for the other 30% (probably going to end hp being a 3 year mortgage on 4% fee). 
 All that said, im 35 and have a small family. This is my introduction to the real estate investment side of things. Was this a smart decision or a bad one?

 I used to be into personal finance and investing (crypto and stocks), but I paused everything for 3 years while I was in Australia. I didn’t follow financial news much during that time. Now I’m back working and trying to reconnect, but I feel rusty.
 The ticket is about USD150. For those who’ve attended his talks before, is it worth it? Is it practical or mostly motivation? And does he usually repeat the same ideas from his books, or does he share new insights?
 Thanks 🙏

Iran is refusing to export its 300kg stockpile of highly enriched uranium, but is willing to dilute the purity of the stockpile it holds under the supervision of UN nuclear inspectorate the IAEA, Iranian sources have said.
The proposal will be at the heart of the offer Iran is due to make to the US in the next few days, as the US president, Donald Trump, weighs whether to use his vast naval buildup in the Middle East to attack the country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have 4 credit cards. I use them all. One is my main card which I typically put 3-5k on every month and then pay it off in full on time every month.
 The others I use for subscriptions and odd purchases here and there, probably a total of about $600 across those cards.
 My total utilization never passes 10%. I applied for a new card because my main one is pretty barebones and doesnt offer many rewards. I found one that has decent rewards for travel and dining, so I applied.
 Credit score: 798
 Total unused credit: 72k
 Current balance across all cards: $3200
 Gross Annual income (combined with wife): 312k
 I got approved and they extended me a $5.1k credit line. This is far lower than my current card. Im just confused about why it would be so low.
 I spoke with a coworker and he said its probably because credit companies want me to carry a balance and they dont want someone who pays it off in full every month. Is this the case?

 Went there and yup, they weren't kidding about the huge racks and piles of camera gear strewn all around. 
 Ngl, it was quite fun sorting around the racks and seeing what gems I can pick out. 
 I wonder, are ther any other places like this around KL? Thrift stores, garage sales, etc?

Gregory Peters, co-chief investment officer of fixed income at PGIM, has noted that bringing political pressure to bear on the Fed is an “own goal” – a self-inflicted shock that erodes confidence and is unlikely to deliver lower borrowing costs for the US.
This reassessment – marked by quiet “sell America” trades – is beginning to surface.

 Today I logged in to my account just because, and see there is a refinance loan open on my account dated 2/18. I didnt ask to apply for a loan i didn’t say i wanted a loan I clearly stated I just wanted info and in the call it was stablished I needed to work on my credit and other things before I did anything… is this legal or even normal?? Did this person create a loan application without my consent?? Is this what happens when you call to ask about info? 
 I did not call to apply for a loan AT ALL!!! Let alone to refinance my 2021 3.25% rate. I don’t know what to do!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need help, with budgeting. Gonna get a real job soon, in puchong, will rent in subang (20+ min travel, by bike). Is my budget good, or is there possible improvements.
 Net salary (after deduction + parents) - 2000, excluding meal allowance(400)
 Rent - 600 (include utils)
 Food - 800 (including groceries, twice a month)
 Fuel + maintenance - 90
 Saving + Investment - 300
 Internet - 50 
 Total - 1840
 I might need to increase the internet, since the room im renting has no wifi. I have no costly hobbies, thats why i decided to topup on food. Really choosy with the room, as i rather have a literal empty room if its squeaky clean. Rarely cook, mostly eat outside, this budget mostly derived from my current spending as an intern.

Police investigating the mistaken kidnapping of grandfather Chris Baghsarian are appealing for information about suspicious car fires that could be related to the case, AAP reports.

 im 22F and i left that house and trying to find a place currently w the savings i have currently.
 i have a few questions if anyone can give me advice
  
legally can my parents and the police do anything to drag me back? going back to abusive parents is the last thing i want to do. id rather die on my own term then their hands
 i am currently doing acca but im planning to drop out because my mental health cant take this anymore. i have a degree in accounting in one of the top unis in the world but little to no job exprince. since im going to be finding a place and living on my own, i will need a job (currently living in airbnbs and crashing at friends houses) is me dropping out of acca to prioritise getting a job a good decision rn? (keep in mind if i dont do this, ill be force to live w abusive parents)
 is it possible for me to get a fresh grad accounting job in less than a month with just my degree and that supports me (rental and food, i do not own a car or any have any loans)
 lastly, as of rn idk what to do, should i go police and report that my dad tried to kill me by strangling me? im scared if i do, theyll just send me back to my parents. do i stay quiet and try to find a fresh grad job asap and cut contact w them completely?
  
any advice would be appreciated

Australia will “examine all options” after the US president Donald Trump announced a temporary 15% tariff would apply to US imports from all countries.
The US president’s move came less than 24 hours after the US supreme court overturned his original 10% import tariff. Shortly after the ruling, Trump announced he was reinstating the 10% duties using a different law before raising it again to 15%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've spent a few hours trying to wrap my head around why people online (see here) are often adamant that a traditional 401(k) and Roth IRA is the way to go - especially with how high the praise is for the latter - yet I don't often see people talking about doing both a Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA. If the Roth IRA is so great, why wouldn't you want to also do a Roth 401(k)? It seems like they adhere to the same taxation rules, so is there something substantially different about Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA accounts that make them fundamentally different animals that I'm just not aware of? Maybe it's simply for diversification? The only real difference I've heard is that Roth IRAs typically allow for more aggressive investment options and the ability to withdraw contributions easier, but that's about it.
 My job allows me to contribute to a traditional and/or Roth 401(k) with a match up to 4% - my understanding is if I were to switch to a Roth percentage, their match would still go to a traditional, pre-tax account instead - and I'm currently maxing it out on the traditional side while maxing a separate Roth IRA. I'm not uncomfortable with that arrangement, but it still irks me not understanding what makes a Roth 401(k) "bad" but a Roth IRA "good" in the eyes of a lot of people (I know it's largely subjective and relative to individuals' goals, but you know what I mean), when they're like... the same thing as far as I can tell.
 Thanks in advance for any information.

 I just turned to 40yo this year. Currently i do part time grab + part time stock trader with income around 3k-5k per month. Below is my current assets, liabilities and monthly spending budget
 Assets:
 ASB - 300k
 EPF - 200k
 Saving - 10k
 Liability:
 House loan - 270k
 Spending:
 Monthly loan payment - 1.5k
 Water and eletric - 300
 Family internet - 300 (include home and internet mobile data)
 Transport - 500
 Groceries - 600
 Balance - 50% to my wife, 50% saving.
 Tbh, i just tired on doing this part time jobs. So i was thinking of looking for jobs. I have degree in accounting. I used to work as an executive of one of sme company till i got vss during covid end of 2019. So for these years, i worked multiple jobs like grab for time being at that time. On year 2021, i drawn into trading stock and investment and become stock trader till today. Unfortunately, i just felt tired at some point, especially when you didn't get to meet your monthly end commitments.
 So i was thinking of looking for jobs, but from what i read and watch, employment is really bad, even for newly fresh graduate. And even i don't think i will get iv after applying jobs based on my age and status. 
 My apology if my post here is a bit "mess up", i dunno the correct word. Anyway, please help me.

My normal take home monthly is about $4200. I know this is well above the recommended 1/3rd of net to be put towards rent. However, I have absolutely no debt whatsoever. I've spent the last 4 years aggressively paying off all of my student loans while living at home and also own my car. I'm pretty confident I can make it on $2600 a month and will still be able to save some money. I mostly just want a nice place to live. Has anyone done something like this successfully? Or is this a terrible idea?

 She is in her late 60’s, working overtime just to survive, going through a divorce with my dad and has a new worrying intake of alcohol.
 Shes started on dating apps and lost $6000 by sending it to her “boyfriend” overseas. I didnt know until it happened, uploaded his picture to google and found the guy her scammer was posing as. This was around 6 months ago, that $6000 was basically her whole savings. I put parental controls on her phone which she was okay with and it worked for a while but she decided she wanted to try again.
 She showed me a check her new “boyfriend” sent to her house, for $900,000 in his name, which was obviously fake. She didnt know it was fake but was worried so she showed it to me. I used the same method and found who this scammer was posing as.
 Do you have any tips on protecting her finances?
 *Edit*
 She realizes her mistakes and has been asking me for help. I dont want to take complete control of her finances, I just want to help her not loose large sums of money.

Parts of the Maga right may be souring on Israel – but a hardline form of Christian Zionism seems to remain unofficial Trump administration policy, if a heated debate between Tucker Carlson and Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, is any indication.
On Friday, Carlson released a confrontational video interview with Huckabee, conducted at Ben Gurion airport in Israel, that vividly illustrated a gaping divide between two factions of the Republican party. On one side is a Christian nationalist stream of the Maga movement, which views the United States’s close relationship with Israel with increasing suspicion. On the other is an older Christian conservative establishment that views that alliance as a totem of US foreign policy – and in some cases believes that Israeli Jews possess a divine right to a large swathe of the Middle East, US public opinion be damned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't get an expensive master's degree unless you truly need it for career advancement (i.e., you have a very concrete and realistic plan of how you will pay for it). 
 I am a teacher at a private boarding school in Massachusetts. A lot of my colleagues found themselves in the workforce for a few years, usually as teachers, then decided that their life felt stagnant and got a master's degree from places like Columbia or whatever. They figured it was a logical next move as a typical "striver" who wants to achieve the next milestone in life, assuming it would lead to new opportunities. Underrated fact: even at places like Harvard, many of these master's degrees are not particularly selective and will enroll almost any baseline smart/competent person - they're a cash cow for the university primarily used to fund their PhD programs! 
 Anyways, these people end up in serious debt and forego earnings while getting the degrees, sometimes in excess of $100,000. And what did they do with their degree? They went back to teaching - basically the exact same job they already had with the same earning potential. 
 I'm curious if this is a pattern in other lines of work - do any of your coworkers also randomly get masters degree at enormous expense that they don't put to good use? In my opinion you should only go to graduate school for a profession that truly requires the credential (JD, MD, etc), or if you get it funded (via a PhD program or through your employer).

Iran’s foreign minister has said he expects to have a draft counterproposal ready within days after nuclear talks with the US this week, while Donald Trump said he was considering limited military strikes.
The US president has ordered a massive buildup of naval forces in the Middle East, including repositioning aircraft carriers and other warships, leading to fears of an imminent war. But it is not clear if the military movements are intended as an intimidation tactic to put pressure on Iran to make concessions on its nuclear programme.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, 26M looking for some advice on whether my current investment approach makes sense for my age and goals.
 I have about RM2.8k per month to invest, and this is my current monthly allocation:
  
ASB: RM1,000/month
 ETFs: RM800/month (I’ve only recently started getting into ETFs)
 Crypto: RM1,000/month (currently higher to take advantage of the bear market)
  
Current portfolio breakdown:
  
ASB: RM120k
 Crypto: RM15k (Only BTC & ETH)
 Liquid: RM15k
  
My goal is long-term wealth growth, and I’m comfortable with some level of risk since I’m still young.
 I’d really appreciate opinions on:
  
Whether this overall strategy looks reasonable for a 26 year old
 If I should be more conservative or more aggressive
 Thoughts on the split between ASB, ETFs, and crypto, especially as I’m just starting with ETFs. Should I put more into ETF to build it up ASAP and slow down on ASB?
  
Thanks in advance for any feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My mother was given US savings bonds from the woman she cared for as a gift, a substantial amount. These were purchased decades ago, back in the 60s-80s. My mom never did anything with them, and the lady ended up passing away about 10 years ago. We recently found them when she was going through some attic stuff. 
 Her husband passed away a decade before she did, and she had no children. Should we just throw them away?
 EDIT: These bonds are not in my mom's name, the lady who passed away just handed them to my mom over the years as gifts.

Conditions in the north-eastern Syrian camp where 34 Australians have been forcibly returned are deteriorating dramatically, with reports of near-nightly raids, and increasingly violent beatings, amid worsening uncertainty over their futures.
The 11 women and 23 Australian children forced back to Roj camp on Monday returned to find their tents – formerly huddled collectively in a row known as Australia Street – demolished and their possessions seized.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, need some advice.. parents are getting to that age when they want to settle their inheritance issue. Our thought is, rather than splitting up assets and giving this sibling this or that to individually manage, it would be better financially to put everything in a trust or a company and have all sibling manage/share it equally. The basic thinking is that we can do more when we pool our assets all together. From what I’ve read online there are some pros to doing this, protection of assets in case of bankruptcy, and more structured financial planning for future generations..
 I’ve briefly talked to some people (relatives who are in a related field) and so far the initial reaction I get is not to do it because it usually causes rifts in the family but when I dig deeper the cause of that is usually because nobody discusses or agrees to exit terms beforehand.
 So, leaving out family dynamics, just wanted some input on whether it financially makes sense and if so what are technical ways to do this? Very interested to hear from people who’ve actually done something like this. TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a 40 year old 2-storey terrace house I had inherited. It used to be rented out but had been abandoned for about 20 years.
 The property is in a mature township and can fetch about RM400,000 for similar (non-abandoned) units. 
 The house is paid off already, so other than taxes, it doesn’t require any maintenance (other than reimbursing my neighbour for fixes affecting them or cutting the grass) . I’ve received offers around RM250,000 pre-COVID but held on to it hoping for something nearer to RM300,000. I presume the new buyer will spend minimum 100k to refurbish the unit. 
 Just want to rule out keeping the property. I have other homes and have a mortgage on my current own stay. Rental isn’t an option as I don’t want to spend any money fixing the house.
 Questions:
  
How is RPGT calculated? 
  
- S&P was done 40 years 
 - Deceased 20 years ago
 - My name on grant by land office only done last year
  
How much agent fees should I expect? 2% of transacted price? 
 
I have bought subsale before and presume legal expenses bourne by purchaser. Is this correct? Do I incur any legal fees as a seller?
 
Any other tips?

The siege and capture of the Sudanese city of El Fasher by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces group last October bore “the hallmarks of genocide”, a UN-mandated fact-finding mission has said.
In a report detailing the harrowing 18-month occupation of the capital of North Darfur, investigators concluded that the RSF and allied militias deliberately inflicted conditions calculated to bring about the physical destruction of the Zaghawa and Fur ethnic communities.

Peru’s congress has elected José María Balcázar, an octogenarian leftist lawmaker who has defended child marriage, as the country’s interim president ahead of general elections in April.
Balcázar is Peru’s ninth president since 2016. The surprise election, in which Balcázar beat the favourite, María del Carmen Alva, a conservative, came after lawmakers voted to remove José Jerí as president on Tuesday after just four months in office, due to a scandal over secretive meetings with Chinese businessmen.

More than 1,000 Kenyans have been lured to fight for Russia in its war with Ukraine, according to an intelligence report to the Kenyan parliament that highlights the scale of a Russian operation taking African men to the frontline.
The majority leader of Kenya’s national assembly, Kimani Ichung’wah, said “rogue recruitment agencies and individuals in Kenya” were continuing to send Kenyan nationals to fight in the conflict, as he read MPs the summary of an investigation by Kenya’s National Intelligence Service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy CNY / holidays guys!
 29M data analyst here. I’ve been in retail for about 4 years (2 companies). With retail volatility lately, company performance has been quite affected. I recently received a contract offer from a major insurance company in KL. +23% from my current permanent role, with 2 days WFH.
 The downside as you know is that it’s a contract role, so there’s always the uncertainty of renewal/absorption. That said, since it’s a big player in the industry, I’m quite tempted to give it a try.
 Wondering what people think about insurance industry as a whole? I've heard some say with premium prices going up, people might stop paying insurance. 
 The industry is totally new to me so any thoughts is appreciated.

Base: RM5,900 /month
 (Fixed) Travel Allowance: RM1,000 /month
 (Fixed) Misc Allowance: RM400 /month
  
In your experience, do new employers usually consider your base salary or overall total salary when offering a salary package? Ie. Will they base an offer based on RM5,900 or my total salary RM7,300. As I might pivot to a non-sales role, so the transport allowance given might not be as high. Thanks for any input!

 Company A (current company)
  
RM8.5K / month (including allowance)
 4 days WFH, 1 day WFO
 1-3 months bonus
 3-4 % annual increment
 21 days AL
  
Company B (new company)
  
RM11.5K / month (matched by asking salary)
 4 days WFO, 1 day WFH
 1 month bonus (on average)
 ? % annual increment (expecting it to be 2-3%)
 14 days AL
  
I truly value work life balance so my current role is perfect plus the culture and work is fulfilling. I also have a side business that generates roughly RM2-3K / month which may be impacted if I work almost fully in office.
 That said, I acknowledge that company B offers growth in terms of salary progression. What are your thoughts?
 Additional Note:
  
The side business is not very scalable.
 Company B's culture seems like a cinaman company, small startup with all guys who tend to communicate in Mandarin (noticed this while waiting for interview), I don't speak Mandarin... Plus you're expected to stay until 7PM but can come in around 10AM+
 Highly unlikely to get a counteroffer by A as I've already been promoted

 I am quite financial illiterate (or investment illiterate), and i want to start with investing. Currently i already have quite some money in asb, and like to start in either
  
Gold
 
Stocks (s&p 500 etc)
 
Crypto
 
 Previously i have dipped my legs in trading crypto, and when btc and eth boom last year, i sold everything (due to in need of money) and get quite a profit. But looking at crypto dip so bad rn, makes me a bit scared. Im not looking to put a lot in one of these three, probably around rm200-rm500 monthly.
 Any advice from the professionals?

US military officials have said American forces launched assaults on three alleged drug-smuggling boats, killing 11 in one of the deadliest days of the Trump administration’s months-long campaign against alleged traffickers.
The military action on Monday brought the number of fatalities caused by US strikes to 145 since September, when Donald Trump called on American armed forces to attack people deemed “narco-terrorists” on small vessels. There have been 42 known strikes in notorious drug-trafficking routes such as the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, according to the Associated Press reported.

My job only lasted 3 weeks since they're planning on doing renovation during Ramadan, and I'm not planning to continue as I'm going to be busy after getting my spm results, most likely. But that's besides the point. 
 I'd like to know how to spend my first salary? I'm planning to save up 80% (since I don't really have any necessities to spend on now anyway), but I've also thought of investing– buying gold, or investing on amanah saham. I've heard it's best to start as early as I can, but I'm not sure. I'd love to know what you guys think! :)

When Boniface Mwangi, the prominent Kenyan pro-democracy activist who plans to run for president in 2027, had his phones returned to him by Kenyan authorities after his controversial arrest last July, he immediately noticed a problem: one of the phones was no longer password protected and could be opened without one.

Walid Saadaoui had once worked as a holiday entertainer, organising dance shows and quizzes at a resort in his native Tunisia. After moving to the UK and marrying a British woman, he became a restaurateur and an avid keeper of birds.

 As we watch the surveillance dystopia unfold across Trump's America, we've spent over a year reporting on the technologies used by ICE, DHS, and other local law enforcement to actively surveil, target and detain citizens and immigrants alike.
 Recently, we uncovered the tool Palantir is making for ICE to find neighborhoods to raid, how local police unmasked millions of surveillance targets because of Flock redaction error and how DHS is lying about killing people in Minneapolis.
 Ask us anything on February 4 at 12 pm ET about the state of surveillance in America. Get your questions in now.
