        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a 24F and just signed a lease for a studio in Chicago. This has always been a dream of mine, and I’m really excited — but now that it’s official, I’m trying to make sure I’m thinking about finances realistically.
 I make about $3.8–4k/month take-home. My rent is $1,425 + $90 utilities, and electric is estimated around ~$100. I also have about $900/month in student loans and a dog, so that adds to my monthly expenses.
 I’ve been at my job for a little over 2 years and things seem stable and trending positively. I also have a solid savings. I don’t feel reckless about the move — I just want to make sure I’m setting myself up well and not stretching too thin.
 For anyone who moved to a big city in their 20s with similar numbers, how did you balance being financially responsible while still actually enjoying the city? Any budgeting tips, side hustle ideas, or “first year living on your own” advice would be appreciated.
 Trying to be smart about this while still enjoying the experience.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, now entering its fifth grim year, has already gone on longer than the entire fight on the eastern front in the second world war. The Soviets marched from the gates of Leningrad to Berlin in a little over 15 months in 1944-45; today the Russian rate of gain in Pokrovsk in Ukraine is 70 metres a day, in Kupiansk, 23 metres, according to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.

 looking to get a new roof, guy asked how I'd be paying and I told him I'd probably just pay it off rather than finance (dumb move).
 later in our conversation I ask him, is 0% financing possible cause why not if there's no interest. 
 he says yes, 0 for 12 months but the bank tacks on $3000 in fees so I'll end up paying more at the end. 
 I've never heard of this and have been quoted a price by many contractors and financed it for 0% if paid off in "x" months. 
 is this guy being honest and is this something that happens with bank financing that I've never known about?

One of the country’s leading tax experts says the explosion in housing wealth has put Australia on the path towards a neo-feudal society where your prosperity depends in large part whether your parents own land or property.
The director of the Australian National University’s Tax and Transfer Policy Institute, Bob Breunig, said “that’s the trajectory we’re on”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I’ve been panicking for last couple of weeks and feel like I’m super stuck.
 I’m a nursing student w crazy credit card debt paying for $900 of rent a month. (Which I know is not a lot) but all my income is basically going to my credit card payments and trying to stay a float. I make around $1200 every 2 weeks as a nurse assistant.
 I’ve tried to get a personal loan to pay off the cards but no one will approve me with my 640 score.
 I’ve called CITI to help me out and basically just paused my payment for a month.
 I was able to pay off a whole credit card from chase all in once and lowered my credit score like 20 points??
 HERES MY INFO
 Debt is in 4 cards:
 -CITI-APR is 18.74% & debt $11,496.01
 -C1- APR is 27.74% & $521
 -C2- APR is 18.49% & debt is $3,444
 -B- APR is around 28% & debt is $5,515 EXPENSES $60 phone $100 groceries $80 utilities $80 extra stuff like gas
 I have around 21k in debt in credit card debt, I’m working full time and picking up extra shifts but it’s getting super crazy busy with school, I just feel overwhelmed. What should I do? Any help as to what to do with debt like this while in school? Should I file for bankruptcy??
 Thanks ):

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm looking for advice on what to do. 
 I withdrew around $1900 from my 529 account to pay for educational expenses, and it was sent via check. I had no issues before withdrawing money and receiving checks, but I thought it was odd that 2+ weeks had passed and nothing in the mail. 
 I called 529 today, and they said the check has been cashed out. I have no idea how, because I didn't receive any check. I told them repeatedly I received no check, and the agent on the line was unhelpful. The agent later created a case number and told me to call back later. Called back later, and another agent keeps repeating "It's been paid" several times even though I kept saying I didn't receive it. It probably got lost in the mail, ended up somewhere else, and someone took my check and cashed it out. I kept asking if they have a method to track where the check was sent, and they said, "we're trying." They told me that all the managers are busy, and they'll call back later. I am assuming they're obviously not going to call back. 
 I am in urgent need of this money. It covers multiple expenses. Is there any advice on what to do?? Can't they check which bank account it was deposited into?? Please help :(

 My employer sent me a 1099 NEC recently, which contained my income for the period of time I was 1099. I used that to file with the IRS. Well about a week ago, I received another 1099 NEC corrected in the mail. This new 1099 has every dollar value box listed as zeroes. Does this mean my employer is trying to void the income I made during that period from my taxes? Do I file an amendment stating the new 1099 NEC corrected? Most importantly, if I already paid the IRS taxes on the reported income, can I get a refund?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been having this debate with my spouse. We have narrowed down make and model, but split between new vs. dealer certified used.
 New is $45-50k
 Certified pre-owned (CPO) (2-3 years old, 35k-50k miles) is $37-42k
 Dealer tells us interest rate for auto loans is in the 6-8% range, which feels too expensive. I lean towards buying the CPO vehicle, and paying all cash. Then save like a maniac for next 6 months to build back the savings account. 
 Spouse thinks buying new is less hassle.
 What’s the consensus here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My spouse and I are looking into individual disability insurance in addition to our employer coverage.
 Both of our employers provide 60% STD and LTD, but we’d feel more comfortable having an additional 20–25% covered through a portable individual policy.
 Background:
  
Me: 28F, finance
 Spouse: 31M, HR
 Combined household income: ~$155k
 Emergency fund: ~$20k, plus additional liquid cash not tied to other goals
  
I’ve read that 80–90% total income replacement is often considered the “sweet spot” for disability coverage. Is that generally true for people in our income range?
 Specifically:
  
Are individual DI policies covering ~20% of income still worth it?
 Is supplemental DI mainly for very high earners, or does it make sense for middle-income dual-earner households too?
 For context,…]]></summary>

Trump news at a glance: president’s decision on Iran attack hinges on last-ditch talks this week

Major institutions of higher education in the US are reckoning with the latest release of the Epstein files after discovering the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein’s relationships with board members, professors and administrators on campuses across the country.
In some cases, professors have been placed under review, research centers closed or conferences canceled. Students and staff have responded in different ways, including petitions, open letters and campus forums.
The supreme court (will be using lower case letters for a while based on a complete lack of respect!) of the United States accidentally and unwittingly gave me, as President of the United States, far more powers and strength than I had prior to their ridiculous, dumb, and very internationally divisive ruling.
For one thing, I can use Licenses to do absolutely “terrible” things to foreign countries, especially those countries that have been RIPPING US OFF for many decades, but incomprehensibly, according to the ruling, can’t charge them a License fee - BUT ALL LICENSES CHARGE FEES, why can’t the United States do so? You do a license to get a fee! The opinion doesn’t explain that, but I know the answer! The court has also approved all other Tariffs, of which there are many, and they can all be used in a much more powerful and obnoxious way, with legal certainty, than the Tariffs as initially used.

“America is WINNING again,” Donald Trump declared last week, unveiling the first batch of Japanese-backed projects under a mooted $550bn investment surge into the US as part of his trade pact with Tokyo.
After the US president tore up the global economic order in 2025, Japan was one among the countries scrambling to strike a deal. They pledged to dramatically increase investment in the US in exchange for lower US tariffs on Japanese exports.

 I'm a 31 year old single woman. I moved to Canada from the middle east 4.5 years ago. My income for the first four years was very minimal, around $2,000 per month as a PhD student and teaching assistant. I could barely save anything, and I thought that was normal. Turns out, I was just lazy and spoiled, splurging like I was rich. 
 I got a job a few months ago. My take home is a little over $5,000. I tracked the past 4 months of my spending and noticed that I am routinely going over $2,000 a month and ~$1,300-$1,500 of it is Restaurants and Grocery. I basically never cook at home.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m 39F. My take-home pay is around RM8.3k, plus RM2k rental income from a property I own.
 Right now I’m staying with my parents. My mortgage + maintenance for my property is about RM3.5k/month. Even after rental, I still top up RM1.5k monthly for a house I don’t live in.
 When I bought the place years ago, I was earning significantly more. I took a 25-year loan because it made sense then. Since then, I’ve had a career change and my income is lower. I don’t regret the change, but financially it’s tighter.
 Here’s what’s weighing on me:
 •I can’t sell the property without taking a loss.
 •If I move into it after the tenant’s lease ends, I’ll be paying RM3.5k out of RM8.3k (~42% of my income) just for mortgage + maintenance. That doesn’t include utilities, furnishing, minor renovations, or general living costs.
 Technically, I can afford it. But it would feel tight. I wouldn’t have much buffer for saving or investing, and that makes me uneasy.
 At the same time, I’m 39 and still living with my parents. They’re not forcing me out, and we’re on good terms. But emotionally, I feel… stalled. I want my own space. I want autonomy. I want to feel like I’m building my life, not just optimizing spreadsheets.
 To make moving out workable, I’m considering refinancing from 25 years to 30 years to lower the monthly instalment.
 Financially, I know it means paying more interest long term. Emotionally, it might buy me independence and breathing room.
 I guess my real question is: Is it foolish to stretch a loan tenure for lifestyle reasons? Or is this one of those times where optimizing for quality of life is valid?
 Would really appreciate perspectives, especially from anyone who’s navigated property decisions after a career/income shift.

 (94k annually, overtime if project calls for it)
 I've been working full-time for around 4-5 months. I'm gearing to move my money around more seriously now I've settled, I'm thinking about cutting my 401k contribution to 5%(min to match). Or just keeping the budget as is and throwing any leftover to it.
 I'm firm on keeping my HYSA for emergency funds.
 Loans
  
Car Loan -17.0k @ 7.9%: Payment Started OCT2024
 Student Loan - 20.5k @ 7.8%: Payment Started FEB2026
 Medical Loan - 1.5k @ 0.0%: Payment Started DEC2025
  
Is there any other place I could cut in my budget? I'm living with parents for a while helping a bit with their bills. VHCOL. Thanks!

 Shock stage over(ish) and I’m starting to look into what’s next. 
 Background - we just had our first child after years of struggles. My wife does not work at the time being. We’re both 40. 
 Main questions for this community are: 
 The job market is rough right now, how secure are we for the time being? 
 Should we consider moving money around/or and selling assets?
 Monies in our investment fund - should we keep it there? 
 A bit worrisome time tied along with the state of the economy. I would appreciate any advice. TY

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My spouse and I co-own a house in a high-tax area (NY) with a sibling. It was my spouse’s childhood home, so there is significant emotional attachment.
 The house is currently rented and roughly covers the existing mortgage. Estimated value is $450k and still owe 85k on mortgage.
 However: • It needs approximately $50k in major, non-cosmetic repairs in the near term (roof, septic, furnace, oil tank). • The home has not had cosmetic updates in ~30 years. • It’s in a high property tax area.
 The sibling would like to be bought out. If we do that, we would need to refinance and take on a new loan. At current rates, the property would likely not fully cash flow. Rent would be close but would not cover principal + interest + taxes + insurance, especially once factoring in upcoming repairs.
 Additional context: • Our personal finances are not in strong shape. • We are carrying debt. • Our credit is not strong. • We are not being approved for favorable traditional loan terms. • We do not have sufficient reserves to comfortably absorb $50k in repairs. • We have young kids and other financial obligations.
 From a purely financial standpoint, selling and splitting proceeds would likely strengthen our situation and reduce risk.
 However, emotionally this is my spouse’s childhood home, and selling it feels like closing a chapter for him.
 My question isn’t just “does this cash flow?” I know the numbers are tight. It’s: how do couples responsibly weigh deep sentimental attachment against financial fragility?
 Is it ever reasonable to carry a property that doesn’t cash flow and needs major capital work if finances are already stretched? Or is that simply too much risk regardless of emotional value?
 Looking for perspective from people who’ve navigated similar decisions.

Earlier this month, China provided a clear answer when it stated that starting on May 1, China will apply zero tariffs on imports from 53 African countries with which it maintains diplomatic relations.
For years, Western governments have promised to rethink their partnerships with their African counterparts, tying positive language about equality and sustainability to complex trade frameworks. China...]]></summary>

Donald Trump’s decision to order airstrikes against Iran will hinge in part on the judgment of Trump’s special envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, about whether Tehran is stalling over a deal to relinquish its capacity to produce nuclear weapons, according to people familiar with the matter.
The president has not made a final determination on any strikes, as the administration prepares for Iran to send its latest proposal this week, ahead of what officials have described as a last-ditch round of negotiations scheduled for Thursday in Geneva.

There is a moment in Channel 4’s drama Dirty Business when Julie Maughan holds the body of her dead child and lets out an anguished cry. It is as brutal as it is compelling.
Her eight-year-old daughter Heather had just died in hospital, two weeks after playing in the sea on the beach at Dawlish Warren in Devon, where she contracted E coli O157, a bug which comes from raw sewage. She became ill with diarrhoea and blood loss. Transferred to Bristol children’s hospital, her parents agreed to switch off her life-support machine after she suffered kidney failure and brain damage.

Due to this increase, my retirement contributions will exceed $70,000 for 2025. While this is a good problem to have, it is a problem I need to rectify. Details below: 
 Contributions: 401(k) $23,500 401(k) Match $9,823.18 ESOP est. $48,320.00 
 I have details from colleagues where this is handled automatically in May/June for the previous year when the contribution is finalized. However, I am also under the impression this excess contribution would be double taxed if not handled by April 15. Should I call my retirement plan manager now to withdraw an estimated amount? And then any minimal remaining excess would be subject to the double tax?

Violence in Mexico after military kills notorious drug cartel boss – a visual guide

With schools still closed, flights cancelled and the charred carcasses of buses smouldering on streets across the country, Mexico was still reeling from the cartel backlash prompted by the killing of cartel kingpin Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, also known as “El Mencho”.
Defense minister, Ricardo Trevilla Trejo, was moved almost to tears on Monday as he offered his condolences to the families of soldiers felled in the operation to kill the country’s most-wanted drug lord. Mexican military personnel, he said, “fulfilled their mission”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm 18 years old, and within the next few months I'm coming into around $160k that my mom put aside for me from around half of my father's life insurance payout. I've known about this for around 5 years, so it isn't unexpected. Despite this, the anxiety surrounding the lump sum is still overwhelming. I have read through this subreddit's wiki and some other advice, but I want more targeted information, and to be completely honest a lot of the information is flying over my head as I'm not financially literate/savvy.
 Here are some things I plan to do in the future: - 2 years of community college (free) --> transfer 2 years state school - Open a Roth IRA and put maximum contributions into it - Put a sum of money into a HYSA - Making diversified investments with a portion of the money (ie. ETFs, bonds, mutual funds) - Likely to be living with my mom for the next 4 years to maximize savings & help with mortgage - Discuss my situation to a non-commissioned financial advisor - Don't touch any of the lump sum unless absolutely necessary
 My mom is also urging me to not use a credit card as I can likely pay most things off with cash, but I don't know if that's the best option. I'll likely only open one credit card and make monthly subscription payments with it, paying it off immediately. I think it's a good fallback in case anything goes wrong, but I'm not an expert in credit and only have knowledge that's scraping the surface.
 Essentially, I would like to know if there are any glaring problems I should be considering in my future financial plan. I don't mind any longer reading materials if it's an investment for my future and well-being.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there - this is about my mother, so any advice would be helpful.
 Background: My mother (F64), was mostly a stay at home mom for the majority of her working career - as she had 6 kids. My dad then walked out on all of us, leaving my mom to go back to school to get her degree and teaching credentials so she could teach Special Education. So she finally has been working in special education at a Charter school (not public) for the last 5 years. (Note - my mother found out years later they weren’t legally married - she found out at city hall when she went to file divorce papers)
 Finances: Because she was a stay at home mom for so long, we are assuming her SS is going to be fairly small. Additionally, she only started a 401k a few years back but only about $5k in it. Thankfully she has no debt.
 Question: How should I help her to plan for any kind of retirement? At this point is maxing out her 401k her best option? Her employer doesn’t match - so should we skip 401k and put it into straight into an IRA? What will give her the most flexibility and biggest return since we don’t really want to wait 30 years for it to grow.
 Note: One of us kids are planning to take her in when she gets older, but she’s young enough now that she loves her freedom and even her mother at 88 currently lives by herself because she likes the freedom.

A least 606 people trying to reach Europe in search of refugee have been reported dead or missing in the Mediterranean since the beginning of 2026, marking the “deadliest start to a year” in more than a decade, the UN’s migration agency said on Monday.
The figure includes at least 30 people who are feared dead or missing after their boat capsized in severe weather off the coast of Greece on Saturday. Authorities rescued 20 people, including four minors, and recovered the bodies of three men and one woman, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), said.

 They haven't refunded me for 3 months. I filed with Amex for a chargeback, its been 2 months since then, I gave them all proofs of what I am owed. Amex rules in my favor, and they said I will get a chargeback issued on my next statement. The next statement date is tomorrow. But I received an email from the bank that they want to issue me a refund and they need my bank account details.
 Should I be giving them my bank account details? I am not sure if that would affect my chargeback tomorrow. Or if I would just get twice the money lol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I am in need of a new vehicle and need help deciding what to do. I have a 2011 Hyundai that has slowly become a money pit. I bought the car in 2021 and after thousands in repairs, new problems continue to come up and I've decided I am done with it. I am 27 and I have only ever bought older used cars in cash.
 I started looking for another vehicle and have test driven a bunch of cars and I have not been happy with any of them. I planned on using ~15k cash to get a used car, nothing special but I am hoping for something with known reliability (Honda or Toyota). But so far every car I've looked at in this range is just not worth the money, high miles, lots of cosmetic damage, or obvious mechanical issues. I even stretched to look at cars closer to 20k and seeing many cars in that price range with over 100k miles and the condition some were in was ridiculous to me. 
 So I learned that it appears the used car market has had quite the shift and used car prices have exploded. So for the first time ever I am considering buying a new car instead of saving $5-10k to buy a used car that I'll have to replace much sooner. I am looking at the 2026 base model Civic which is around $26k. I currently make $67k (~$4500 net/mo) with no debt other than a cheap mortgage and my monthly expenses including "extra/fun" money comes out to about $2000. On a rough estimate, I believe close to 15k down and hopefully a bit of trade in value, it looks like I might be looking at a $250-300 payment for 60 months. 
 Considering I hope to keep the car for 10+ years, is this a good idea? Or a completely horrible idea and I should keep looking for a used car?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m 29 and live with parents so I save on rent. Although my choice is not driven by savings but because of cultural customs to stay home until marriage. Family has stopped me from leaving before.
 Some financial info; I make $85k working mostly remote (very seldom do I have to travel or commute), have $35k in Roth IRA, $7k in 401k, $1k in HSA, $45k across savings, checking, and brokerage accounts, $21k student debt, and annual expenses are approx $5k (internet, auto insurance, student loans, trash). This is my split of bills I pay for the household internet, trash, an all auto vehicle insurance. I do not pay for food or rent. This wasnt set up, it just everyone happened to pick certain bills they can help with.
 My relationship with family is very strained. I won’t go into detail but I will just say that I am completely isolated at home. I work remotely so I need quiet space and have had this issue with my family previously but they moved me into a room that used to be a garage and is close to the laundry and food pantry. There is a lot of activity during the day (we are all 7 living in the same house) and they would turn the washer and dryer during my work hours even though this was communicated before. Long story short, even before this, my relationship with them was never close and it comes from years of conflict. 
 But they won’t let me move out. This is more culturally than financially because I’m a woman and blah blah women should stay home until marriage. 
 I need to make a decision and need help with determining if I should buy a home with my sister or rent. I feel like renting is such a waste but also understand that buying coming with a lot of expenses im not ready for. 
 Would the best option for me be to rent a small studio maximum $1700 rent, or buy a small condo at a max of $300k?

More than 45 days after a brutal January crackdown that left thousands of Iranian protesters dead, students across several universities are protesting again. As Iran’s new academic term began on Saturday, students in Tehran gathered on campus, chanting anti-government slogans, despite a heavy security presence and plainclothes officers stationed outside university gates.
The Guardian spoke to protesting students about why they were rallying despite the fact that thousands had been killed and tens of thousands arrested in the January demonstrations.

 I’m a 33 yo male working as a senior data analyst earning 12k myr per month net. I have an mba from a foreign university where i got a 3.71 gpa but decided to return to Malaysia after i graduated. 
 My previous role prior to data analytics was in business development in the same company I’m at today but I feel like the contents of my job are lacking so I’ve been thinking about entering into management consulting. Given that I’m an experienced professional already, what do you think are the chances of getting into a decent firm and do you have any experience to share regarding the consulting industry?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m budgeting for a 2-bedroom move from the Philly area down to Florida. I spent all week getting quotes, but the business models and contracts are completely different. I need someone financially savvy to tell me which one is actually the safest bet, because I am terrified of hidden fees.
 **Quote 1 (Ryder Relocations - The Broker): $2,400**
 * _The catch:_ It’s a 'Non-Binding' volume estimate. My research on Reddit shows they act as a broker and sell the job to a third-party driver. I've read absolute horror stories on here about them doubling the price on moving day, but $2,400 is so cheap it's tempting.
 **Quote 2 (Fairprice Movers - Local PA Carrier): $4,600**
 * _The catch:_ It’s more expensive upfront, but it is a **Guaranteed Binding Quote**. They put it in writing that they do a strict numbered inventory, do not use transfer warehouses, and use their own dedicated crew for the entire PA to FL drive. The price legally cannot change.
 **Quote 3 (United Van Lines - Major Corporate): $6,800**
 * _The catch:_ It’s based on weight. If my stuff weighs more at the highway weigh station, the price goes up. Also, because they consolidate shipments, they gave me a 2-to-21-day delivery window. I work from home and can't wait 3 weeks for my desk, but they are big!
 From a purely financial/risk standpoint, is it mathematically smarter to lock in the $4,600 binding quote with Fairprice so my budget is protected, or should I roll the dice with the cheap Ryder quote and hope for the best?

Residents of one of India’s most upmarket neighbourhoods say the country’s first “musical road” has turned their daily lives into a nightmare soundtrack.
A stretch of Mumbai’s recently opened Coastal Road seafront expressway has been engineered to play the pulsating Oscar-winning tune Jai Ho from the movie Slumdog Millionaire when vehicles drive on it at lower speeds.

New South Wales authorities are preparing for about a third of the group of Australian women and children linked to Islamic State fighters to return to the state, if authorities in Syria allow them to leave the Roj refugee camp.
The premier, Chris Minns, said the state government had been discussing the possible return of some of the 11 women and 23 children with federal government agencies since late 2025, and a strong law enforcement response was expected.

 I wasn't really familiar with ETFs so I read through this sub abit and found VWRA was a good one and I have somewhat of an understanding of what it is. However, I see alot of you DCA into it which I think means putting abit abit each month since it's safer incase you invested during a bad time.
 Should I still do this? I'm thinking yes, but what's a good amount and time interval? I've downloaded Fsmone (still waiting for my account to be approved, it's been a week :() and is it safe to put in this much money? 
 I don't plan to use this money at all and I can sustain myself with my job so ideally I'd want to put 80+% of the million.
 Thanks in advance

Anthony Albanese says former opposition leader, Sussan Ley was “undermined” by conservative colleagues, Angus Taylor and Andrew Hastie, during her 276-day tenure in the seat.
Speaking to Hit 104.9, which covers Ley’s southern NSW electorate of Farrer, the prime minister criticised the Coalition’s recent internal turmoil while praising his own side of politics. Albanese said:
From day one, she was undermined by Angus Taylor and Andrew Hastie and a range of them who weren’t really working to try to get her success in the party. …
It’s, I think, unfortunate that politics can be a pretty rough game, and that [Ley] was elected by the Liberal party caucus, fair and square, she was the leader, but never even got to give a budget reply. I don’t know if that’s happened before. I’m not sure, but certainly she didn’t even get one year in the office, which is pretty rough.
We want to ensure that people who leave our country and go to terrorist hotspots, people who go there to support terrorist organisations or to support Islamic State or organisations or other terror listed organisations, and then who actually commit crimes over there … they can’t come back to Australia.
I’ve got a newsflash for the government. They are the government. They can change the law. If the law is not strong enough to keep Australians safe and to keep people out who actually hate Australian values and hate the Australian way of life, and who have left our country to fight for an alternate way of life, then we should change those laws.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys. I have a background in maths and finance, and I've been working on a set of trading strategies for FX and stocks, currently looking to paper trade before deploying fully through an algorithm. Whats a good platform to use? For stocks I currently have moomoo, but idk how it would work with my automation. Also how would capital gains tax work if im regularly buying and selling a stock?
 As far as FX goes, is there a good platform that is safe? I'm finding it hard to get good advice on it because most people i know who trade Forex are those Forex bros using dodgy unregulated platforms like Justmarket that offer up to 3000x leverage which i think is kinda predatory. I have worked in asset management before and done some investing but pretty clueless as far as actual active day trading goes. Whats a good pip spread for currency pairs like USD/EUR? which platforms offer them, and as far as leverage goes whats a healthy and safe range I could play with or do you think it would be better to stay clear of that?
 Let me know what you think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[拍拖本来是甜甜的事情，但有时候，现实问题一来，心真的会很累。 近日，大马一名女子在「XUAN」发文表示，自己在两性关系中遇到了很大的困扰，不知道该不该继续坚持下去。 她说，男友不支持 AA 制，认为情侣之间不必算得太清楚。但她坚持 AA，是因为不想以后谈婚论嫁时，为钱财问题产生更多矛盾。她说，如果用「这次你请，下次我请」的方式，她常常会忘记上一次是谁付钱，心里反而更有压力。 更让她难受的是，只要男友请客，她就会觉得亏欠对方。她有时晚餐只想简单吃个面包，但男友却坚持要她点饭，还说吃不完他可以帮忙吃。如果她想喝 100Plus，男友也会阻止，说不如去商场买，更便宜，叫她改喝别的水。她觉得，连吃什么、喝什么，都要被管。 除了金钱观不同，男友的性格也让她很为难。男友常常和家人发生争执，就算她在场，对方也会直接开骂，完全不顾她的感受。她尝试过劝说，有话可以好好讲，不一定要用骂的方式，但男友始终觉得自己没有错，也听不进她的意见。 她也提到，男友很喜欢为自己的错误找借口。她生日那天，自己订了一家喜欢的餐厅，晚上 8 点用餐。因为两人住在不同地方，她提议各自前往餐厅，但男友坚持要先到她家载她。她提醒男友要早点出门，至少预留一小时，因为晚餐时间会塞车。没想到，男友还是在 7 点 30 分才出门，结果迟到，餐厅位置也没了。 她非常生气。男友虽然道歉，却解释说「没想到会塞车」。她无奈地说，自己已经提醒过，为什么还是拖到最后才出门？男友却表示，平时没有遇到塞车。最后，她还是选择原谅。 她坦言，每次吵架，男友都会主动说对不起，但她感觉对方并没有真正理解问题。无论她如何耐心解释，对方始终觉得自己是对的。 在报备行踪方面，两人也有分歧。男友认为没有必要报备，因为她也没有要求自己报备。但她表示，男友每天都会和异性聊天，甚至聊完后删除聊天记录，这让她没有安全感。她只是希望对方简单报备一下，却被男友反驳：「当初就是因为你不需要我报备，我才选择和你在一起。」 女子无奈表示，这段感情让她越来越累。她不知道，是自己太计较，还是两人真的不合适。她把经历分享出来，只希望听听大家的意见，也想弄清楚，这样的关系是否值得继续。 ▼ 继续在一起会很痛苦的，分吧！ 感情不是谁对谁错，而是能不能互相体谅。如果一直委屈自己，这段感情还能走多远呢？

 I’m 20, starting college in five months(paying for it by working during school), and have $30k in savings, $17k in gold/silver, and $1.6k in my Roth IRA. I haven’t contributed to my 2025 Roth yet (deadline April 15, 2026) and already put $1.6k toward 2026. My goal is early financial freedom, but I prefer staying cash-heavy and wanted $35k saved before college. I’m deciding whether to use some savings to max my 2025 Roth contribution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Around a year ago, I was sick for a prolonged period, so I decided to go to my university's health center. The university advertises that students who take x or more credits (which I qualfiied for) "do not pay copays or coinsurance for provider visits at [name]! " . I also asked the front-desk if/how much would be billed to insurance, and they said that it should be covered for students. It turned out to be the flu, and the only thing that the medical staff member did was give me a flu and covid test. The next day, I am completely fine and recover on my own after the week-ish of abnormal shivers and sickness. I would have never went to the student care if they provided price transparency instead of deceiving students.
 I then get a bill for ~$400, and although insurance adjusted it by a bit, it's still $300. It's not covered by insurance because my insurance has a high deductible.
 I have heard that you can negotiate even if you have insurance, so long as you are willing to pay immediately. If they bring the bill down to a REASONABLE amount ($100-150), I would be able to pay immediately.
 Can someone please provide me with some tips to negotiate this urgent care visit given the circumstances of me being a student (I still am a student) and it being health services provided by the university?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Malaysia’s Islamist party is taking control of the opposition coalition following months of internal rift, which could increase its influence and disrupt the political landscape ahead of a general election.
 The Perikatan Nasional alliance named Ahmad Samsuri Mokhtar from the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party as its chairman, a move that will embolden PAS and allow it to assert its dominance.
 PAS's leadership of the opposition coalition may lead to a period of competitive conservatism, with a clash of Islamic narratives between PAS's more dogmatic approach and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's moderate Islam.

 I am a CPA and am working in a company that has been bought out by a pe firm. I am not sure if they will layoff but we were told if that happens there will be severance. It’s a wonderful company but I figured that starting q2 I will start looking for another job as I see people who have been here over 10 years resigning.
 I have about 60k in an emergency und and this would cover about 1 year of expenses for me. I have 72k ina 401k. I know I am behind on retirement savings so I am now saving the max for 401k and I save about 2 k every month. My salary is 170k and there is a 55k bonus that would be paid out next march. Is this an ok savings rate? My mortgage is under 80k, at 3.75%.
 Also is 60k a decent emergency fund? This would cover 1 year of expenses for me. Do you think I should just pay off the mortgage? My monthly mortgage payment is 2000, of which 500 is property tax.

I need some additional funds for closing costs, repairs, and furniture. Interest rates are 6% right now. Should I take out a mortgage or get a 50k loan from my 401k? I could also not do renovations right away (new master bath and kitchen) and save up for them later but there could be some things that need to be repaired in the beginning (electrical, appliances). I have a good amount already saved for retirement. My salary is 109k a year with stable long term employment. I am married and my husband has a lot saved up but refuses to contribute (but he covers expenses for our primary house).

 I get access to a 401k with max $12,500 employer contribution, ESPP that I can contribute 1-15% of my paycheck to, and a HSA. What is worth prioritizing my money towards first? I was trying to max out my 401k, then $200 per paycheck to HSA then I'm lost about ESPP. How much should I be trying to put towards ESPP? I'm still trying to get a budget figured out. Thanks in advance!

Violence erupts after Mexican security forces kill drug cartel boss ‘El Mencho’ 

The drug lord “El Mencho”, who was killed on Sunday by Mexican special forces, was the co-founder and leader of a gang that in recent years had become the country’s most powerful criminal organisation: the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG).
While less internationally famous than the Sinaloa cartel of the now imprisoned Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, the CJNG is a household name in Mexico, where it is known for its displays of ultraviolence and its big, military-style arsenal.

She is now 9 months old. Unfortunately, I have to rehome her, and I'm desperately seeking helpful advice on how to make this process easier for both her and myself.
 I've been planning to immigrate to Australia from Malaysia for a few months now. While I'm excited about this new chapter in my life, I am also heartbroken that I need to rehome my cat. I can't take her with me due to the strict pet relocation rules in Australia, and Malaysia is not an approved country for relocating pets. Even if it was, I wouldn't have the financial means to cover the expenses.
 Has anyone here gone through a similar situation? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

The one card has $6,659.92 and APR is 26.49%, another card with $7,068.72 has an APR of 21.49%, the last card has $741.66 with $35.99% APR. I make payments to all of these monthly, but I just can't seem to make a dent with the interest piling on top. My car is going to need replaced soon, so I'm panicking about having all of these lines of credit open and not being able to have a decent downpayment on a new (to me, but still used) car. I can't afford $500/month in a car payment, so I'm trying to figure out if consolidating my debt is worth it at all or what I should do here. I never learned financial literacy and I'm trying to teach myself and I'm struggling HARD. :(

New York mayor Zohran Mamdani has ordered a citywide travel ban for all but emergency travel, as the north-eastern United States was preparing for an intense winter storm that is forecast to reach blizzard strength and bring major disruption.
Residents along the east coast scrambled to prepare for the late-winter storm that spurred weather warnings from Maryland to Massachusetts, affecting more than 35 million people. More than a foot of snow was expected, with wind gusts of up to 70mph and warnings of potential coastal flooding from Cape Cod to Delaware.

The New South Wales environment watchdog has ordered Sydney Water to remove fats from its Malabar wastewater treatment plant, a month after Guardian Australia revealed a huge fatberg was responsible for the poo balls that closed beaches last summer.
Sydney Water isn’t sure exactly how big the fatberg is because it cannot easily access the area where it has accumulated. It could be the size of four Sydney buses.

Who was El Mencho, the former police officer who co-founded an ultraviolent cartel in Mexico?

One of the world’s most wanted drug traffickers, the Mexican cartel boss known as “El Mencho”, has been killed by security forces, Mexico’s defence ministry has confirmed. The operation set off a wave of violence, with torched cars and gunmen blocking highways in more than half a dozen states.
The drug lord, whose real name is Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, was killed on Sunday in the western state of Jalisco along with at least six alleged accomplices, the ministry said in a statement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, this is weird and hopefully makes sense.
 I was alerted today by both Chase and Experian that a dormant credit card account with Chase was suddenly active. Looking into Experian, the charged amount was $3300. Of note, I recently signed up for Experian alerts after freezing my credit. The account says it was opened in 2010 on Experian. I have no record of this account and when I talked with a Chase representative, they say my only credit card with them has a zero balance. I typed in the last 4 of the account in question and Chase says it’s not an account with them. It says I am an authorized user on Experian, my parents don’t have any Chase cards and I’ve never been on any of their cards as a User. Same with other relatives
 So far so I have: - sent a secure message to Chase with pictures from Experian of this account in question - filed a dispute with all 3 credit bureaus
 What the heck is going on? It doesn’t even seem like this account exists with Chase! Chase was super unhelpful and confused as well and I’ve been unable to talk to Experian. FYI I didn’t freeze my credit for any particular reason other than my mom telling me she froze her credit.

Police searches of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s former home on the Windsor estate in Berkshire continued on Sunday as a government minister did not rule out having a judge-led inquiry into the former prince’s links with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, representing the government, did not rule out such an inquiry but said it was premature because of the police investigation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I opened up a 360 Checking account with Capital One a few weeks ago with the intent of using it a secondary account to send wire transfers from since you are able to do it online instead of in-person like my other bank requires (the closest branch is very far away since I moved. However, whenever I go to the "wire transfer" section via the Capital One dashboard I get an error stating "this account is too new". I called support and they just said "they think its like 30-60 days, maybe" but couldn't give me a definitive answer. 
 So tl;dr: does anyone know how long until my Capital One 360 Checking account needs to be open for before I can send a wire transfer? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m about to work two jobs. My “main“ job is a part time job at a grocery store, which has been cutting my hours and the store director gets in a mood whenever we stay over so more often than not it’s not an option. They never promote any full time workers, so getting full time is extremely unlikely. I told myself I either need to find a better job or a second job.
 So far the only other place to have contacted me back and hire me is another grocery store. I’ll be working morning and mid shifts at the first one, closing at the second.
 Issue is, the hours of my first job fluctuate— I can be working less then 20 hours for months, but then suddenly be working over 30 hours, six days a week, the next couple weeks. Which means I can be working 50+ hours some weeks with two jobs. I also have my benefits and paid vacations at the first job that I’m reluctant to lose right away and start over at another job.
 However, I need the finances. I’m in student loan debt, have to pay for my own groceries, am trying to move out of a toxic household, and would need to eventually pay for other expenses later on. Working at my inconsistent first job alone isn’t enough anymore if I’m going to survive off only $200 each week on my low weeks.
 I am worried about burn out, though, and the lack of a social life and time to myself. Since my off days are inconsistent at both jobs, I can’t guarantee any days off unless I request off (and since I’m opening at the one, closing at the other, my whole day will be booked). I am going to see how it goes and if I can’t handle it, I’ll quit one of the jobs. I’ll also continue looking for better jobs and side hustles in the meantime. 
 But I just wanted to ask if it’s worth doing two jobs in my circumstances? I know the answer seems obvious. But I’m just worried about burn out. At the very least, any tips on how to endure and not feel so burn out?

Ministers will unveil a “generational” overhaul of special educational needs and disabilities (Send) support, pledging £4bn to transform provision in schools in England and warning councils they could lose control of Send services if they fail to meet their legal duties.
The reforms are expected to be a key policy moment for Keir Starmer and for the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson – who delayed the changes last autumn after a ferocious backlash from MPs and parents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a 2015 Silverado with 139,380 miles. I owe about 11k on the truck. The transmission is slipping and the transmission fluid is dark in color (lighter brown/black) and can smell it burning. it made a trip hauling a 12 foot U-Haul trailer 1,300 miles like this with no problem. So I figured if the tranny was going to go out it would have then. My transmission cooler lines are also leaking, and I have an oil leak. or I can pay 4k and someone offered to buy it for 7k and just get out of the loan by paying the 4k and get something else in a few months. The cost to repair everything will probably be around 8,000$ which I really don’t have right now.
 Do I sell it and spend 4 k to get out of the loan and eventually get a new vehicle, or spend the 8 k to fix it while I owe 111k and it has 140k miles?

Iran and the US are expected to meet for a further round of talks in Geneva this week in a sign that Donald Trump’s team believes Tehran is making serious proposals to dilute its stockpile of highly enriched uranium and show it is not seeking a nuclear weapon.
As fears loomed of renewed conflict after Washington carried out a major redeployment of military assets to the region, the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said he thought there was still a good chance of finding a diplomatic solution.

I put 2k aside every month into ASB. EPF is approximately 2k a month (employee + employer). I'm thinking of either putting RM500 aside for ETFs or taking a small chunk of my monthly ASB savings and putting into ETF. It should look something like this: RM1.5k ASB & RM1k ETF
 Is that a smart move? Please help a bro out as I'm financially illiterate. What other investment options are there?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this is probably common knowledge for folks... but I always figured there was a limit to how high insurance companies will jack your rates over time. I was wrong, and hopefully this will help some others.
 I've been noticing my escrow payments slowly climbing over the years. there have been some large fires in my area that destroyed a lot of homes as well as tax increases, so I chalked it up to that for a long time. Payments had gotten to ridiculous levels lately (north of $1k per month through Liberty Mutual), so I finally decided to shop around.
 I ended up reducing my premium by 75% for significantly better coverage by switching to another company... Not naming names since I don't want this to seem like an ad. just a warning. When I called to cancel, the retention agent had the gall to insinuate it was my fault for not calling earlier to complain. apparently, loyalty for nearly a decade and no claims filed isn't enough to get a low rate. 
 tl;dr - if you haven't checked your insurance rates lately, do it. They might be boiling you like the proverbial frog. I don't know if all companies do this, but screw Liberty Mutual. Oh, and your commercials are annoying.

Top US trade negotiator Jamieson Greer insisted on Sunday that the Trump administration was set to persist with its tariffs policy, two days after the supreme court declared many of Donald Trump’s tariffs illegal.
The ruling issued on Friday by the highest US court was a sharp rebuke to the Republican president that toppled a key pillar of his aggressive economic agenda – even as it prompted Trump to announce a new global tariff using different statutes, albeit temporary.

I could get a house now for $500-$600k but those are all in areas I don’t really want to live. I currently have $300k ready for a down payment but thinking I may need $400k saved to make the loan more suitable. My retirement is currently around $700k, I make $160k annual with a $50k bonus. No debt. It may be more of a wants versus needs conversation but I’m curious if others think this is too much to spend on a house with my numbers?

Searches are expected to continue today at Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s previous home – Royal Lodge, in Windsor – as calls grow for a probe into the former prince’s links with Jeffrey Epstein.
Lucy Hough speaks to the Guardian’s police and crime correspondent, Vikram Dodd, about what could be next for Andrew here:
If the government bring forward this bill with the support of the King then we will back it. We have to be realistic. Andrew is the eighth in line to the throne, so there’s no chance of him becoming our monarch.
And so parliament really should be focused on things that are of more importance to the public, whether that’s the economy, crime, the health service, immigration. But if the bill does come before parliament, then we’ll support it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im in the planning/estimating phase of a new home build. 
 So here's the situation. I already own the land and there is a house on the lot. We live in it but it needs everything. Roof, mold mitigation, every wall is plaster, subfloor are warped, electric and plumbing are shot, hvac is not installed right, every window and door is clapped, foundation is crumbling, Ghosts ect.
 I could throw 200k at it and we would still have problems. Zillow estimate puts us at 350k but houses around here sell for like 600k+ and we're in a primo spot so tbd on what we will appraise at.
 The house sits on a 5 acer plot and I want to build a new house next to it and demo the old one. 
 I have a background in engineering and I manage contractors for a living so I want to be my own GC. The house will be a barndo. I have quotes for the kit, construction, site work and ill bid out the other trades when we're ready for rough in work once all the framing is done.
 Question is should I take out a construction loan? I was looking into FFBKC since they let you be your own GC and lend for the barndo concept 
 Or should I take out a HELOC and borrow what's needed. Or cash out refinance and use the money from that.
 I have about 100k cash for this venture and no debt. I make 145k annually.

Mom is a stay at home housewife so she usually cooks me lunch for me to bawak bekal to office. Same goes for dinner, as she cooks for the whole family.
 I am also naturally frugal and dont spend much on clothes or outing. No financial commitment as well. No girlfriend, car, or any student loan. I also commute to work by public transport everyday. So technically I only spend about RM200 out of my pocket every month for Netflix, PS+, late night kopitiam etc. This means I save RM4k/month on the regular after deducting all my expenses.

The mother of a student who was killed in the 2023 Nottingham attacks has said she will “fight to the bitter end” to get to the truth of how Valdo Calocane was free to attack, before the beginning of a public inquiry into the incident.
Barnaby Webber and Grace O’Malley-Kumar, 19-year-old students, and 65-year-old caretaker Ian Coates were fatally stabbed by Calocane on 13 June 2023 in a frenzied attack. Early the next day, Calocane drove a van into pedestrians Wayne Birkett, Sharon Miller and Marcin Gawronski, leaving all three with severe and life-changing injuries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I got into a dispute with ATT because they of a trade in. I turned in my phone to upgrade to an s25 and they said it would cover the bill of the s25. After six months I was still being billed the full price. After several calls they said they never got it. I called the store and they said they don’t have records dating back six months. I recorded all these conversations. I got in touch with someone from their “office of the president” who played phone tag with me for a week and then claimed the matter was resolved in an email. 
 I got sick of it and went to Verizon. ATT sent me a bill for 800. They charged my credit card which I disputed because I did nott consent to that charge. I logged in to my att portal and it shows I have a negative balance of $765. 
 What is the best course of action here?

The US Secret Service shot and killed an armed intruder who breached the perimeter of Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump’s Florida residence and private club in Palm Beach, early on Sunday.
Although the US president often spends weekends at the ocean resort, he was at the White House in Washington during this incident, as was first lady Melania Trump.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I currently hold over $10k in a HYSA. My living expenses are roughly $1k-1.5k a month (renting from friend's parent) and I make on average $3.2k a month (Contract work). Got nailed by taxes pretty hard ($6k), and I'm looking at how to plan moving forward outside of memorizing the tax code for my state lol.
 My original plan was to set up a sinking fund to cover moving out expenses (10%) and put 15% into the Rath. However that plan needs to be put on pause for obvious reasons. Now I could dip into my efund and simply adjust said plan, with the 15% going into rebuilding it and the 10% going into the IRA, but while these taxes are definitely scary, I think I can pay them off with monthly payments and by filing an extension. I had no issues paying them off last year, so I don't have a negative reputation with the IRS. That and the last thing I need is to pay off taxes only for an actual emergency to happen.
 What do yall think? Is this a sound approach to dealing with these expenses? Would you deem taxes a suitable emergency? Should I drop everything (including the Rath) to pay these off (Baby Step 2)? Would love your feedback.
 If I don't respond immediately, I'm on the way home. Thanks everyone!

Graeme Wearden: Trump’s trade war risks undermining his hopes of hefty US interest rate cuts

High-level talks with the US administration over the threat of increased tariffs are under way as the UK government says it wants “the best possible deal” for UK companies.
Business leaders said they expected the UK to “double down” on the existing Economic Prosperity Deal (EPD) – announced by Donald Trump and Keir Starmer in May last year – rather than walk away.

I would like to move gradually.
 
 If I take money from a IRA for a down payment on a new home, I have to repay the IRA within 60 days or incur a $50,000. tax hit. I think that’s too risky. 
 I spoke to a lender who recommended the following: I believe the best option for P would be obtaining a new mortgage, using her retirement funds for the down payment, & adding a recast option to her mortgage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I’m from Sarawak, and I would like to respectfully seek guidance regarding a family heirloom . It is an old Iban Kain Kumbu textile that has been passed down through approximately 4–5 generations in my family.... l am not sure but would like to ask an expert about this!!
 Family lineage timeline:
 • My late great-great grandmother • Passed down to my late great grandmother • Then to my grandmother • Then to my mother • Now in my possession 
 According to my mother’s oral history, this textile was worn by an ancestor named Niang Inik Kantan. The longhouse origin is unfortunately unknown as most elders in our family have passed away sadly no information was to further explaining more about this Kain Kumbu
 The piece appears:
 • Handwoven • Naturally dyed (earth tones, deep browns, muted red/blue) • Smaller in size compared to modern 1970s–1990s Kain Kumbu • In good structural condition • Has a natural woody scent consistent with aged textile storage 
 I am genuinely seeking:
 1. Advice on authentication. 2. How to verify age (pre-1900? 1800s?). 3. Whether museum textile experts in Sarawak or Malaysia would be appropriate to consult. 4. General historical context of early Kain Kumbu weaving. 
 I deeply respect its cultural and spiritual value, and I want to approach this carefully and correctly. Because this is from our family heirloom and been on generations...
 Any guidance from historians, textile experts, collectors, or museum professionals would be sincerely appreciated.
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know the topic of including international stocks has come up a few times this week, but I finally made the change. A few years ago I read The Simple Path to Wealth and started following it's principles, not perfectly, but as well as I could in my situation with a young family. I have been watching VXUS over the past year due to seeing an interview with J.L. where he mentioned that he would tell his daughter to watch out for international stocks starting to outperform U.S. stocks due to changes in the global economy. When I saw his blog post this month, I decided to include international stocks as well and I intend to be invested in them long term. 
 I saw another post here that recommended moving all stocks to VT for it's simplicity and just let it ride. However, isn't cost also a major factor? I wanted to keep an eye on costs and implement this in the most cost effective way possible. What I did is take a portion from VTI and move it to VXUS, which will give me a better expense ratio and have very similar performance as just holding VT. VT has an expense ratio of .06%, VXUS is .05%, and VTI is .03%. So, for example, if I have a total of $10,000 invested with approximately $6,000 in VTI and $4,000 (about 60% U.S. and 40% international) I'm only paying .03% for the bulk of my stock portfolio and .05% for the international component instead of .06% to hold everything in one fund. It's easy for me to rebalance to keep about the same ratios as VT as well because I add to the fund throughout the year and can add a little more to VTI or more to VXUS to keep in line with VT. What are some of the arguments against this approach? Is it just for simplicity and not tinkering with your investments?

Donald Trump has told Netflix to remove the Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice from its board or “face the consequences”, while the streaming platform is locked in an extraordinary corporate battle to take control of Warner Bros Discovery (WBD).
In comments posted on his Truth Social platform, the US president described Rice – who served as national security adviser to Barack Obama and UN ambassador and White House adviser under Joe Biden – as a “political hack” and accused her of having “no talent or skills”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought a car almost 2 months ago from a CDJR dealer in MI
 Paid deposit, signed, took truck home. When time came to pay, we hadn’t received any information on the bank yet. We called the dealer and they had us come back in since they worked a better deal out with the same bank- cool whatever better deal
 Now apparently our payment is due tomorrow, but nothing is finalized at the bank STILL.
 Our temp tag expires tomorrow as well. Not too sure what to do or go around this.

I’m not sure that I want to transfer to my current employer because I read that they do not match at all. I’m not sure what is recommended in this situation but I am asking for guidance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last summer my father made a poor choice when he needed a new roof - he went through Erie Roofing, financed through Goodleap, and paid probably twice as much as he should have. He passed away unexpectedly a few weeks ago and we don’t know what to do about the loan. He was the only name on the loan, we have no estate because he didn’t have many assets or money. Nearly all of his bank accounts had me listed in trust and the house is in his and my mother’s name (she is still with us.) my mother is on Social Security and it may not be enough for her to live off of and keep the home, although we are going to try, but the loan will make it nearly impossible. I hate the idea of not paying a debt, but is there any option that allows us to have the loan forgiven due to his death?
 Also - the salesman for Erie specifically told my parents that if he were to die the loan would not have to be repaid, I feel like that was a predatory move on his part and not fully accurate.

Fewer than one in 10 boys aged 14 to 16 in the UK read daily, according to research, which found reading for pleasure was being crowded out of teenage lives by schoolwork, screens and sports.
While reading declines for both boys and girls in early adolescence, there are “signs of recovery” among girls in later teenage years, but boys’ engagement remains persistently low, according to the National Literacy Trust (NLT).

A Guardian analysis of government records has found that the vast majority – 77% – of people who entered deportation proceedings for the first time in 2025 had no criminal conviction, exposing a stark gap between the Trump administration’s rhetoric and reality.
Within days of Donald Trump’s inauguration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) trotted out a phrase that his surrogates would come to use over and over again: “the worst of the worst.”
Fewer than half of the people in the data (40%) had any criminal charge against them, and only 23% had a conviction.
Of those who did have a criminal conviction, nearly half were for non-violent traffic and immigration offenses.
Traffic offenses alone made up nearly 30% of the convictions, the largest category by far.
Some 9% of criminal convictions were for assault, while only 1% were for sexual assault and just 0.5% were for homicide.

Scotland Yard is using AI tools supplied by the US tech company Palantir to monitor staff behaviour in an attempt to root out failing officers, the Guardian has learned.
The Metropolitan police has previously declined to confirm or deny whether it used technology supplied by the company, which also works for the Israeli military and Donald Trump’s ICE operation. It has now confirmed that it is using Palantir’s AI to analyse internal data about sickness levels, absences from duty and overtime patterns in an effort to identify potential shortcomings in professional standards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently bought an off plan studio apartment in Dubai. specifically Dubailand Residence Complex. There are goijg to be major changes and upgrades to the area by 2030. Metros being built, community filling up, 3 malls, a city dedicated to students right above it, new etihad rail, etc... huge developments. price was 548k aed which is 149k usd give or take. now, the studio is 319 sqft and its projected to get done in q3 2028. Current rent there is 45k aed a year (12250 usd/year). 
 The eay its going with inflation and general uptrend of studio rent prices/the upgrades to the area I mentioned earlier everyone is predicting rent to be 55k aed a year (roughly 15k usd) so the roi seems good. 
 payment plan is 20% upfront and 1500 usd a month until completion which will be 50% of the property then after that ill have 20% more saved up meaning ill have to get mortgage for the other 30% (probably going to end hp being a 3 year mortgage on 4% fee). 
 All that said, im 35 and have a small family. This is my introduction to the real estate investment side of things. Was this a smart decision or a bad one?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just found out that Robert Kiyosaki is coming to Malaysia on Feb 27 and I’m not sure if I should attend.
 I used to be into personal finance and investing (crypto and stocks), but I paused everything for 3 years while I was in Australia. I didn’t follow financial news much during that time. Now I’m back working and trying to reconnect, but I feel rusty.
 The ticket is about USD150. For those who’ve attended his talks before, is it worth it? Is it practical or mostly motivation? And does he usually repeat the same ideas from his books, or does he share new insights?
 Thanks 🙏

Iran is refusing to export its 300kg stockpile of highly enriched uranium, but is willing to dilute the purity of the stockpile it holds under the supervision of UN nuclear inspectorate the IAEA, Iranian sources have said.
The proposal will be at the heart of the offer Iran is due to make to the US in the next few days, as the US president, Donald Trump, weighs whether to use his vast naval buildup in the Middle East to attack the country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have 4 credit cards. I use them all. One is my main card which I typically put 3-5k on every month and then pay it off in full on time every month.
 The others I use for subscriptions and odd purchases here and there, probably a total of about $600 across those cards.
 My total utilization never passes 10%. I applied for a new card because my main one is pretty barebones and doesnt offer many rewards. I found one that has decent rewards for travel and dining, so I applied.
 Credit score: 798
 Total unused credit: 72k
 Current balance across all cards: $3200
 Gross Annual income (combined with wife): 312k
 I got approved and they extended me a $5.1k credit line. This is far lower than my current card. Im just confused about why it would be so low.
 I spoke with a coworker and he said its probably because credit companies want me to carry a balance and they dont want someone who pays it off in full every month. Is this the case?

 Went there and yup, they weren't kidding about the huge racks and piles of camera gear strewn all around. 
 Ngl, it was quite fun sorting around the racks and seeing what gems I can pick out. 
 I wonder, are ther any other places like this around KL? Thrift stores, garage sales, etc?

Gregory Peters, co-chief investment officer of fixed income at PGIM, has noted that bringing political pressure to bear on the Fed is an “own goal” – a self-inflicted shock that erodes confidence and is unlikely to deliver lower borrowing costs for the US.
This reassessment – marked by quiet “sell America” trades – is beginning to surface.

 Today I logged in to my account just because, and see there is a refinance loan open on my account dated 2/18. I didnt ask to apply for a loan i didn’t say i wanted a loan I clearly stated I just wanted info and in the call it was stablished I needed to work on my credit and other things before I did anything… is this legal or even normal?? Did this person create a loan application without my consent?? Is this what happens when you call to ask about info? 
 I did not call to apply for a loan AT ALL!!! Let alone to refinance my 2021 3.25% rate. I don’t know what to do!

 Net salary (after deduction + parents) - 2000, excluding meal allowance(400)
 Rent - 600 (include utils)
 Food - 800 (including groceries, twice a month)
 Fuel + maintenance - 90
 Saving + Investment - 300
 Internet - 50

 I might need to increase the internet, since the room im renting has no wifi. I have no costly hobbies, thats why i decided to topup on food. Really choosy with the room, as i rather have a literal empty room if its squeaky clean. Rarely cook, mostly eat outside, this budget mostly derived from my current spending as an intern.

Trump’s rhetoric has ratcheted up tensions between the United States and Denmark, while putting the global spotlight on the Arctic as he insists mineral-rich Greenland is vital for US and Nato security against Russia and China.
He said the boat would treat many “sick” people in Greenland, without providing any details on...]]></summary>

 im 22F and i left that house and trying to find a place currently w the savings i have currently.
 i have a few questions if anyone can give me advice
  
legally can my parents and the police do anything to drag me back? going back to abusive parents is the last thing i want to do. id rather die on my own term then their hands
 i am currently doing acca but im planning to drop out because my mental health cant take this anymore. i have a degree in accounting in one of the top unis in the world but little to no job exprince. since im going to be finding a place and living on my own, i will need a job (currently living in airbnbs and crashing at friends houses) is me dropping out of acca to prioritise getting a job a good decision rn? (keep in mind if i dont do this, ill be force to live w abusive parents)
 is it possible for me to get a fresh grad accounting job in less than a month with just my degree and that supports me (rental and food, i do not own a car or any have any loans)
 lastly, as of rn idk what to do, should i go police and report that my dad tried to kill me by strangling me? im scared if i do, theyll just send me back to my parents. do i stay quiet and try to find a fresh grad job asap and cut contact w them completely?
  
any advice would be appreciated

Australia will “examine all options” after the US president Donald Trump announced a temporary 15% tariff would apply to US imports from all countries.
The US president’s move came less than 24 hours after the US supreme court overturned his original 10% import tariff. Shortly after the ruling, Trump announced he was reinstating the 10% duties using a different law before raising it again to 15%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've spent a few hours trying to wrap my head around why people online (see here) are often adamant that a traditional 401(k) and Roth IRA is the way to go - especially with how high the praise is for the latter - yet I don't often see people talking about doing both a Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA. If the Roth IRA is so great, why wouldn't you want to also do a Roth 401(k)? It seems like they adhere to the same taxation rules, so is there something substantially different about Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA accounts that make them fundamentally different animals that I'm just not aware of? Maybe it's simply for diversification? The only real difference I've heard is that Roth IRAs typically allow for more aggressive investment options and the ability to withdraw contributions easier, but that's about it.
 My job allows me to contribute to a traditional and/or Roth 401(k) with a match up to 4% - my understanding is if I were to switch to a Roth percentage, their match would still go to a traditional, pre-tax account instead - and I'm currently maxing it out on the traditional side while maxing a separate Roth IRA. I'm not uncomfortable with that arrangement, but it still irks me not understanding what makes a Roth 401(k) "bad" but a Roth IRA "good" in the eyes of a lot of people (I know it's largely subjective and relative to individuals' goals, but you know what I mean), when they're like... the same thing as far as I can tell.
 Thanks in advance for any information.

 I just turned to 40yo this year. Currently i do part time grab + part time stock trader with income around 3k-5k per month. Below is my current assets, liabilities and monthly spending budget
 Assets:
 ASB - 300k
 EPF - 200k
 Saving - 10k
 Liability:
 House loan - 270k
 Spending:
 Monthly loan payment - 1.5k
 Water and eletric - 300
 Family internet - 300 (include home and internet mobile data)
 Transport - 500
 Groceries - 600
 Balance - 50% to my wife, 50% saving.
 Tbh, i just tired on doing this part time jobs. So i was thinking of looking for jobs. I have degree in accounting. I used to work as an executive of one of sme company till i got vss during covid end of 2019. So for these years, i worked multiple jobs like grab for time being at that time. On year 2021, i drawn into trading stock and investment and become stock trader till today. Unfortunately, i just felt tired at some point, especially when you didn't get to meet your monthly end commitments.
 So i was thinking of looking for jobs, but from what i read and watch, employment is really bad, even for newly fresh graduate. And even i don't think i will get iv after applying jobs based on my age and status. 
 My apology if my post here is a bit "mess up", i dunno the correct word. Anyway, please help me.

My normal take home monthly is about $4200. I know this is well above the recommended 1/3rd of net to be put towards rent. However, I have absolutely no debt whatsoever. I've spent the last 4 years aggressively paying off all of my student loans while living at home and also own my car. I'm pretty confident I can make it on $2600 a month and will still be able to save some money. I mostly just want a nice place to live. Has anyone done something like this successfully? Or is this a terrible idea?

 She is in her late 60’s, working overtime just to survive, going through a divorce with my dad and has a new worrying intake of alcohol.
 Shes started on dating apps and lost $6000 by sending it to her “boyfriend” overseas. I didnt know until it happened, uploaded his picture to google and found the guy her scammer was posing as. This was around 6 months ago, that $6000 was basically her whole savings. I put parental controls on her phone which she was okay with and it worked for a while but she decided she wanted to try again.
 She showed me a check her new “boyfriend” sent to her house, for $900,000 in his name, which was obviously fake. She didnt know it was fake but was worried so she showed it to me. I used the same method and found who this scammer was posing as.
 Do you have any tips on protecting her finances?
 *Edit*
 She realizes her mistakes and has been asking me for help. I dont want to take complete control of her finances, I just want to help her not loose large sums of money.

Parts of the Maga right may be souring on Israel – but a hardline form of Christian Zionism seems to remain unofficial Trump administration policy, if a heated debate between Tucker Carlson and Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, is any indication.
On Friday, Carlson released a confrontational video interview with Huckabee, conducted at Ben Gurion airport in Israel, that vividly illustrated a gaping divide between two factions of the Republican party. On one side is a Christian nationalist stream of the Maga movement, which views the United States’s close relationship with Israel with increasing suspicion. On the other is an older Christian conservative establishment that views that alliance as a totem of US foreign policy – and in some cases believes that Israeli Jews possess a divine right to a large swathe of the Middle East, US public opinion be damned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't get an expensive master's degree unless you truly need it for career advancement (i.e., you have a very concrete and realistic plan of how you will pay for it). 
 I am a teacher at a private boarding school in Massachusetts. A lot of my colleagues found themselves in the workforce for a few years, usually as teachers, then decided that their life felt stagnant and got a master's degree from places like Columbia or whatever. They figured it was a logical next move as a typical "striver" who wants to achieve the next milestone in life, assuming it would lead to new opportunities. Underrated fact: even at places like Harvard, many of these master's degrees are not particularly selective and will enroll almost any baseline smart/competent person - they're a cash cow for the university primarily used to fund their PhD programs! 
 Anyways, these people end up in serious debt and forego earnings while getting the degrees, sometimes in excess of $100,000. And what did they do with their degree? They went back to teaching - basically the exact same job they already had with the same earning potential. 
 I'm curious if this is a pattern in other lines of work - do any of your coworkers also randomly get masters degree at enormous expense that they don't put to good use? In my opinion you should only go to graduate school for a profession that truly requires the credential (JD, MD, etc), or if you get it funded (via a PhD program or through your employer).

Iran’s foreign minister has said he expects to have a draft counterproposal ready within days after nuclear talks with the US this week, while Donald Trump said he was considering limited military strikes.
The US president has ordered a massive buildup of naval forces in the Middle East, including repositioning aircraft carriers and other warships, leading to fears of an imminent war. But it is not clear if the military movements are intended as an intimidation tactic to put pressure on Iran to make concessions on its nuclear programme.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, 26M looking for some advice on whether my current investment approach makes sense for my age and goals.
 I have about RM2.8k per month to invest, and this is my current monthly allocation:
  
ASB: RM1,000/month
 ETFs: RM800/month (I’ve only recently started getting into ETFs)
 Crypto: RM1,000/month (currently higher to take advantage of the bear market)
  
Current portfolio breakdown:
  
ASB: RM120k
 Crypto: RM15k (Only BTC & ETH)
 Liquid: RM15k
  
My goal is long-term wealth growth, and I’m comfortable with some level of risk since I’m still young.
 I’d really appreciate opinions on:
  
Whether this overall strategy looks reasonable for a 26 year old
 If I should be more conservative or more aggressive
 Thoughts on the split between ASB, ETFs, and crypto, especially as I’m just starting with ETFs. Should I put more into ETF to build it up ASAP and slow down on ASB?
  
Thanks in advance for any feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My mother was given US savings bonds from the woman she cared for as a gift, a substantial amount. These were purchased decades ago, back in the 60s-80s. My mom never did anything with them, and the lady ended up passing away about 10 years ago. We recently found them when she was going through some attic stuff. 
 Her husband passed away a decade before she did, and she had no children. Should we just throw them away?
 EDIT: These bonds are not in my mom's name, the lady who passed away just handed them to my mom over the years as gifts.

Conditions in the north-eastern Syrian camp where 34 Australians have been forcibly returned are deteriorating dramatically, with reports of near-nightly raids, and increasingly violent beatings, amid worsening uncertainty over their futures.
The 11 women and 23 Australian children forced back to Roj camp on Monday returned to find their tents – formerly huddled collectively in a row known as Australia Street – demolished and their possessions seized.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在大马赚钱不容易，她好不容易月入五位数，却换来满身压力。 近日，大马一名女子在 Facebook《XUAN》发文表示，她在大公司打拼多年，从月薪 RM2,800 一路做到月入超过 RM20,000，她本以为事业稳定后，感情也会越来越好，没想到两人的距离却越来越远。 她说，从小家庭背景不好，不想再经历过口袋里只剩 RM30，却还要等三个星期才发薪水的日子。那种不安感，让她对「没钱」特别害怕。为了不再回到过去，她几乎一年无休地工作，用时间和健康换收入。别人看到的是光鲜亮丽，但只有她知道，那是无数个熬夜换来的成绩。 男友是她的第二段感情。刚毕业时，两人都在努力工作。她选择进入大公司实习，一步一步慢慢往上爬。男友却选择做传销行业，相信自己会成为那个幸运儿，赚到大钱。 四年过去，她的收入稳定成长，从四位数变成五位数。男友的收入却一直不稳定。好的时候 RM2,000 至 RM3,000，不好的时候甚至只有 RM100。虽然她不喜欢传销行业，但因为男友热爱，她一直支持。有时候她会帮忙买 RM1,000+ 的产品，也介绍亲戚朋友加入。但是如果有人拒绝，男友就指责她不够用心，说这个行业需要人脉，她必须介绍更多人，他才有收入。 最近他的收入真的不稳定，开始依赖她生活。虽然我们没住在一起，但他的租金是女子一个人承担。这个月男友搬来同住，本以为在一起会更加幸福，却发现生活开销暴涨。两人外出吃一餐就要花 RM100 至 RM200，再加上娱乐、礼物、衣服，甚至 iPhone，多数由她买单。每个月在男友身上的花费至少 RM3000 以上。 男友却说自己负责开车接送，油费很贵。到了月尾，他又向她哭穷，让她还油钱，她也真的给了。 更让她难过的是，男友几乎不做家务。她每天工作到很晚，回家还要收拾残局。 她开始怀疑，这段感情到底是爱，还是负担？她给他吃穿用度，还被男友 PUA 说她 「回家休息不赚钱就是错！」 贴文一出，引起不少网民热议。有人心疼她的付出，也有人劝她认真思考，这段感情是否真的值得继续。 ▼ 分！ ▼ 把钱花在自己身上更好 感情本来就是两个人一起努力，如果只剩一个人在撑，这样还能走下去吗？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, need some advice.. parents are getting to that age when they want to settle their inheritance issue. Our thought is, rather than splitting up assets and giving this sibling this or that to individually manage, it would be better financially to put everything in a trust or a company and have all sibling manage/share it equally. The basic thinking is that we can do more when we pool our assets all together. From what I’ve read online there are some pros to doing this, protection of assets in case of bankruptcy, and more structured financial planning for future generations..
 I’ve briefly talked to some people (relatives who are in a related field) and so far the initial reaction I get is not to do it because it usually causes rifts in the family but when I dig deeper the cause of that is usually because nobody discusses or agrees to exit terms beforehand.
 So, leaving out family dynamics, just wanted some input on whether it financially makes sense and if so what are technical ways to do this? Very interested to hear from people who’ve actually done something like this. TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a 40 year old 2-storey terrace house I had inherited. It used to be rented out but had been abandoned for about 20 years.
 The property is in a mature township and can fetch about RM400,000 for similar (non-abandoned) units. 
 The house is paid off already, so other than taxes, it doesn’t require any maintenance (other than reimbursing my neighbour for fixes affecting them or cutting the grass) . I’ve received offers around RM250,000 pre-COVID but held on to it hoping for something nearer to RM300,000. I presume the new buyer will spend minimum 100k to refurbish the unit. 
 Just want to rule out keeping the property. I have other homes and have a mortgage on my current own stay. Rental isn’t an option as I don’t want to spend any money fixing the house.
 Questions:
  
How is RPGT calculated? 
  
- S&P was done 40 years 
 - Deceased 20 years ago
 - My name on grant by land office only done last year
  
How much agent fees should I expect? 2% of transacted price? 
 
I have bought subsale before and presume legal expenses bourne by purchaser. Is this correct? Do I incur any legal fees as a seller?
 
Any other tips?

The siege and capture of the Sudanese city of El Fasher by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces group last October bore “the hallmarks of genocide”, a UN-mandated fact-finding mission has said.
In a report detailing the harrowing 18-month occupation of the capital of North Darfur, investigators concluded that the RSF and allied militias deliberately inflicted conditions calculated to bring about the physical destruction of the Zaghawa and Fur ethnic communities.

Peru’s congress has elected José María Balcázar, an octogenarian leftist lawmaker who has defended child marriage, as the country’s interim president ahead of general elections in April.
Balcázar is Peru’s ninth president since 2016. The surprise election, in which Balcázar beat the favourite, María del Carmen Alva, a conservative, came after lawmakers voted to remove José Jerí as president on Tuesday after just four months in office, due to a scandal over secretive meetings with Chinese businessmen.

More than 1,000 Kenyans have been lured to fight for Russia in its war with Ukraine, according to an intelligence report to the Kenyan parliament that highlights the scale of a Russian operation taking African men to the frontline.
The majority leader of Kenya’s national assembly, Kimani Ichung’wah, said “rogue recruitment agencies and individuals in Kenya” were continuing to send Kenyan nationals to fight in the conflict, as he read MPs the summary of an investigation by Kenya’s National Intelligence Service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy CNY / holidays guys!
 29M data analyst here. I’ve been in retail for about 4 years (2 companies). With retail volatility lately, company performance has been quite affected. I recently received a contract offer from a major insurance company in KL. +23% from my current permanent role, with 2 days WFH.
 The downside as you know is that it’s a contract role, so there’s always the uncertainty of renewal/absorption. That said, since it’s a big player in the industry, I’m quite tempted to give it a try.
 Wondering what people think about insurance industry as a whole? I've heard some say with premium prices going up, people might stop paying insurance. 
 The industry is totally new to me so any thoughts is appreciated.

In your experience, do new employers usually consider your base salary or overall total salary when offering a salary package? Ie. Will they base an offer based on RM5,900 or my total salary RM7,300. As I might pivot to a non-sales role, so the transport allowance given might not be as high. Thanks for any input!

 Company A (current company)
  
RM8.5K / month (including allowance)
 4 days WFH, 1 day WFO
 1-3 months bonus
 3-4 % annual increment
 21 days AL
  
Company B (new company)
  
RM11.5K / month (matched by asking salary)
 4 days WFO, 1 day WFH
 1 month bonus (on average)
 ? % annual increment (expecting it to be 2-3%)
 14 days AL
  
I truly value work life balance so my current role is perfect plus the culture and work is fulfilling. I also have a side business that generates roughly RM2-3K / month which may be impacted if I work almost fully in office.
 That said, I acknowledge that company B offers growth in terms of salary progression. What are your thoughts?
 Additional Note:
  
The side business is not very scalable.
 Company B's culture seems like a cinaman company, small startup with all guys who tend to communicate in Mandarin (noticed this while waiting for interview), I don't speak Mandarin... Plus you're expected to stay until 7PM but can come in around 10AM+
 Highly unlikely to get a counteroffer by A as I've already been promoted

Silicon Valley tech billionaires will land in Delhi this week for an AI summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, where leaders of the global south will wrestle for control over the fast-developing technology.
During the week-long AI Impact Summit, attended by thousands of tech executives, government officials and AI safety experts, tech companies valued at trillions of dollars will rub along with leaders of countries such as Kenya and Indonesia, where average wages dip well below $1,000 a month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I am quite financial illiterate (or investment illiterate), and i want to start with investing. Currently i already have quite some money in asb, and like to start in either
  
Gold
 
Stocks (s&p 500 etc)
 
Crypto
 
 Previously i have dipped my legs in trading crypto, and when btc and eth boom last year, i sold everything (due to in need of money) and get quite a profit. But looking at crypto dip so bad rn, makes me a bit scared. Im not looking to put a lot in one of these three, probably around rm200-rm500 monthly.
 Any advice from the professionals?

My job only lasted 3 weeks since they're planning on doing renovation during Ramadan, and I'm not planning to continue as I'm going to be busy after getting my spm results, most likely. But that's besides the point. 
 I'd like to know how to spend my first salary? I'm planning to save up 80% (since I don't really have any necessities to spend on now anyway), but I've also thought of investing– buying gold, or investing on amanah saham. I've heard it's best to start as early as I can, but I'm not sure. I'd love to know what you guys think! :)

When Boniface Mwangi, the prominent Kenyan pro-democracy activist who plans to run for president in 2027, had his phones returned to him by Kenyan authorities after his controversial arrest last July, he immediately noticed a problem: one of the phones was no longer password protected and could be opened without one.

Walid Saadaoui had once worked as a holiday entertainer, organising dance shows and quizzes at a resort in his native Tunisia. After moving to the UK and marrying a British woman, he became a restaurateur and an avid keeper of birds.
All the while, however – as the Guardian’s community affairs correspondent, Chris Osuh, explains – he was hiding a secret: he had pledged allegiance to Islamic State.

Tika Basnet sat facing the glow of her iPhone, a red tika pressed into the center of her forehead. Seven-month-old Briana slept on her lap, her breathing soft and uneven. On the other side of the screen was Mohan Karki, Basnet’s husband, who had yet to hold his daughter.
For Karki, nearly 9,000 miles (14,500km) away, it was already morning. He was in hiding in south Asia, his exact location withheld for his safety, his face breaking into pixels as he watched his daughter sleep.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[新年要扮美美，不少人都会提前做好「变美三宝」，像是做美发、护肤、美甲等。然而，在追求精致外观的背后，可能隐藏着你意想不到的受伤风险。 中国杭州一名 22 岁女子日前做了一款心仪已久的美甲，没想到在隔天骑电动摩托时发生意外，导致指甲连同甲床断裂，甚至引发指骨骨折。 根据《新民晚报》报道，王姓女子为了让手指看起来更修长，还特意贴了延长甲片。不料，她隔天骑车时却不慎摔倒，手掌本能撑地，结果导致左手食指上的延长甲片连同甲床直接断裂流血。她随即前往杭州市临平区中西医结合医院骨科就诊。 经检查发现，王女左手食指出现指骨骨折、甲床破裂，部分甲床外露，必须通过手术修复。院方为她进行指骨骨折闭合复位内固定手术，目前术后恢复情况良好。 接诊的曹立副主任医师指出，如果没有这么细长复杂的美甲，伤势也许不会这么严重。其延长甲片会增加手指的受力面积和杠杆作用，一旦摔倒，很容易产生撬动效应，导致指甲撕脱、甲床损伤，甚至引发骨折。 曹医师也表示，虽然王女情况属于极端个例，但美甲确实会影响手部正常活动，而且指甲造型越复杂，影响就越明显。频繁做美甲或做不当美甲，存在不少健康隐患。 例如，打磨甲面容易让甲层变薄易断；美甲环境不卫生，可能引发指甲真菌感染；频繁去死皮、使用卸甲水或甲油胶等，可能增加过敏性皮肤病或感染性皮肤病等疾病风险；若美甲油质量不佳，还可能诱发呼吸疾病。 此外，曹医师还提醒指甲的生长周期一般为 3 个月，因此两次美甲最好间隔 3 个月以上，且不建议选择过于复杂或者带有突出装饰的款式。 美甲不是不能做，是要适度，别让一时爱美换来受伤和健康代价。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annual Dinner 抽奖活动是员工参加最期待的环节，但中奖全凭个人运气。 最近，台湾一名网友在 Threads 发文，抱怨公司年会大奖被刚一名刚入职不到 3 个礼拜的新人抽中，让身为老员工的自己心里很不平衡！ 不是我小心眼 但这种真的会让人心里超不平衡欸？ 我们在这边撑几年的 结果新人三周直接带走最大奖？？ 而且他还一脸「蛤是我吗」那种样子 我真的会翻白眼 帖文曝光后引发热议，不少人认为年会抽奖，只要是正式员工，就该一视同仁，人人都有机会。 ▼ 就算没有新人，中奖也不会是你 ▼ 讲这么多就是小心眼 ▼ 其实就是运气问题 不过，也有人认同 PO 主的心情，年会本就是拿来犒赏员工一整年的努力，新人刚入职，过去对公司没有任何贡献，公司应该做调整奖品分配方式。 ▼ 新人只有资格抽小奖？ 事后，PO 主再度回应称，自己只是单纯好奇大家的想法，分享当下的真实感受而已，无意针对或攻击那名新人。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[拍照竟变去做苦工！本地一名摄影师在 Threads 分享，以前为客户拍摄婚礼照片时，被当作「佣人」般对待的心酸经历。 他表示，最初的初衷是想以可负担的价格为新人提供摄影服务，没想到这个决定给自己带来意想不到的磨难，也让他感到后悔。他当时定了低价后，目标客户群发生了变化，从原本经济有能力的，变成了没多少钱但又想充面子的人。 事情发生在 2017 年，当时他才开始从事摄影工作。他接下了一单包含婚礼注册仪式（Akad nikah）和婚宴两场仪式，总报酬仅 RM700 的工作。 一大早，他就到场查看婚礼布置和灯光设置，突然被一位 Aunty 叫去搭婚宴帐篷。当他说明自己是摄影师、主要工作只在室内时，对方竟讽刺他是懒男人、找各种借口。超出职责范围的要求让他印象深刻，深感无奈。 此外，他还遇到一些意外情况。原本他为一对新人拍摄，但对方在未提前告知的情况下，让另一对新人「共享」他的拍摄服务，对方等于付一次钱就以为能得到「买一送一大礼包」。他当场明确表示，如果要继续拍摄，需要额外支付费用。最终，他没有继续为第二对新人服务。 不仅如此，他还被新人临时要求拍摄超出原本约定的内容，对方让他把所有到场宾客都拍一遍，包括邻居和各种熟人。 好心却被有心人利用！经过这些经历，他深刻意识到，接单前必须明确规定工作范围和收费标准，避免被占便宜，让自己吃亏。同时，他也提醒大家今后接单一定要提前沟通清楚。

 As we watch the surveillance dystopia unfold across Trump's America, we've spent over a year reporting on the technologies used by ICE, DHS, and other local law enforcement to actively surveil, target and detain citizens and immigrants alike.
 Recently, we uncovered the tool Palantir is making for ICE to find neighborhoods to raid, how local police unmasked millions of surveillance targets because of Flock redaction error and how DHS is lying about killing people in Minneapolis.
 Ask us anything on February 4 at 12 pm ET about the state of surveillance in America. Get your questions in now.
