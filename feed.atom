I’ve been working full-time as a paralegal making $46,000 per year in family law, which is the area I have experience in, and I’ve been saving aggressively while my expenses are low.

The Green party has predicted a “seismic moment” in UK politics, with a party source telling the Press Association:
Things are feeling positive. Not wanting to get ahead of ourselves, but everything that we thought that was going to be happening looks like it’s happening … Whatever happens, I think it’s fair to say that Greens are here to stay now as a progressive voice in British politics.

Sarah Mitchell, the NSW shadow minister for health, said revelations two people had died after an outbreak of fungal infections at a major Sydney hospital were “shocking”, calling for more transparency from the Minns government.
As reported yesterday, the Sydney local health district said the two deaths and four other infections resulted in Royal Prince Alfred Hospital closing its transplant unit temporarily. The infections occurred between October and December, and the SLHD is investigating the source. A spokesperson said on Thursday that fungal spores of the common mould aspergillus could be stirred up by construction works. RPA has been undergoing a major redevelopment since 2023.
The revelations that multiple patients died due to a fungal outbreak at Royal Prince Alfred hospital are shocking. Patients go to hospital to be cared for, not to be exposed to life-threatening infections.
The staff, patients and families of those who lost their lives deserve transparency.
We must recognise that violence has an immediate and long-term cost for all – therefore reforming the systems that currently harm or inadequately protect women and children must be a priority – and simply money makes a difference.

The New South Wales health minister has denied “covering up” a deadly fungal outbreak at one of Australia’s largest hospitals, saying it was not publicised to avoid “unnecessarily scaring people”.
The cluster of infections caused by aspergillus, a common mould, killed two patients and left four others unwell in the inner-Sydney Royal Prince Alfred (RPA) hospital’s transplant unit in late 2025.

 Istana Negara dalam satu kenyataan hari ini memaklumkan, Seri Paduka Baginda dinasihatkan oleh pakar perubatan supaya berehat dan tidak berangkat ke sebarang majlis bagi memberi ruang kepada proses rawatan dan pemulihan.
 Menurutnya, disebabkan Yang di-Pertuan Agong sedang menjalani rawatan susulan, Seri Paduka Baginda tidak dapat berangkat ke majlis berbuka puasa bersama Perdana Menteri, Jemaah Menteri, Ketua Perwakilan Asing dan Pegawai Kanan Kerajaan di Istana Negara, kelmarin.
 “Selain majlis perasmian Masjid Universiti Pertahanan Nasional Malaysia (UPNM) Sultan Ibrahim semalam, yang telah ditangguhkan ke suatu tarikh yang lain,” katanya.
 Tambahnya, Yang di-Pertuan Agong bertitah akan kembali berangkat ke majlis-majlis rasmi sebaik kesihatan Baginda beransur pulih. – MalaysiaGazette.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My vehicle was totaled Dec 2025.
 I am financing the car thru a (CO) credit union- There’s a $5230.32 remaining balance on the loan with an interest rate of 6.49%.
 The lease at my place ends May 31st & I’d like to try to get rid of my car before then because I won’t have anywhere to store the car.
 To my understanding, I can’t junk the car because the title has a lien on it.
 Are financial lenders (credit union in this instance) willing to negotiate if my account is in good standing currently? Or do I have to miss payments? Any guidance on how to talk to them too would be helpful, I’ve had so much anxiety about this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[你能接受大龄差的爱情吗？ 根据「TTN 谈谈网」报道，近日，大马一名炒粿条档主在社交媒体匿名发文，引起网民热议。 这名男子今年45岁。他说自己是母胎单身。虽然不是大老板，但一直靠着自己的双手赚钱。他每天炒粿条，日卖 100 份，日入过 RM1000+。他觉得自己的收入还算不错。 他说自己的样子「五官是齐的」，只是排列比较随性一点。身材方面，他笑称自己「有一点点福气」。 他也公开了找另一半的要求。他希望另一半五官端正，年龄 21 到 25 岁，会做家务，也会生孩子。他觉得要求并不高。 他的朋友听到他想找 21 岁的女生后感到十分惊讶。但他认为爱情不分年龄。他坦言每天工作很累，回家想看到青春一点的脸。 当朋友再问，年轻女生图他什么时，他说： 「我有档口，我会炒粿条，还可以免费给她加蛋加虾。」 他也坦言，自己不是不懂现实。只是偶尔也想要幻想一下，希望有一个清纯可爱、会顾家、不会嫌他胖的老婆。 他说：「也许不是女生要求高，而是他还没认清市场。45 岁的我，还在想 25 岁的梦。」 贴文曝光后，引来不少网民留言。有者批评他的要求太高，也有人劝他早点睡，面对现实。 ▼ 炒完粿条早点睡吧... ▼ 想找便宜老婆免费做家务生孩子？ ▼ 你还是单身好... ▼ 小女孩图你什么哦？ 这件事也让人想，找对象自由归自由，但现实还是要面对的啦。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think this is worth the risk so tell me why I'm wrong. Niece is 19 and working full time at a low-wage job, trying to get an apartment with a friend. Total rent+utilities will be around $1100 and their combined income is about $2400 take home. She has been on her own for about a year with roomates, but she just doesn't have any credit history because she's young. She's not a saint but she's basically a responsible person.
 I know I'm on the hook for the rent if they bail, plus damages to the apartment. I can make them get insurance, or buy it myself. 
 I believe that you should never loan money to anybody unless you can stand to lose it, so I accept that there's a chance this goes south and I'm on the hook for her lease.
 Our credit is excellent, we own our home, and we own our cars. We have a good income and plenty of savings so if the worst happens and we have to pay off the lease, it won't ruin us. I don't anticipate needing to apply for any loans myself anytime soon, so if our credit takes a ding it's not the end of the world.
 Knowing the risk of essentially paying my niece's rent if she flakes or something happens, is there any other reason I shouldn't do this? What am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do not deal with this company under any circumstances! I cannot state this emphatically enough. They are the absolute worst customer service organization that I have ever dealt with during my 45 year career after having owned five companies. 
 It took two years of badgering them with countless phone calls and emails to many different contacts, from both me and my affected employee, before they finally were able to correct funds we both contributed that were mistakenly put into a non-Roth IRA account.
 It took six months for them to terminate my company’s 401(k) profit sharing plan. We dealt with at least four different people and kept getting passed onto another person without understanding why. 
 Their business strategy is clearly to delay the process as long as possible so they can collect their outrageous fees. 
 They charged me over $3000 just to close three employee accounts in our plan, then over $2000 more against my personal account before funds were removed.
 They also made an error in my contributions where I overpaid by $3000 and was given no recourse to recover it.
 If you look at Yelp reviews, most customers give them one star and say they would rate them lower but are not provided with that option.
 Please do yourself a favor and find a better company that actually cares about their clients. This is a huge hassle and massive waste of time!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm finishing graduate school this year, and am looking for tips on which loan from my FAFSA I should pay off first to reduce the total amount I'd be paying and pay off as soon as possible. 
 Some background about my situation: I do have a job with the salary around $60,000. I currently live with my parents, (moved back in for family reasons, but no rent at least). My monthly spending hovers around $300 without unexpected emergency expenses. 
 My loans are as below. I haven't paid any of it yet since starting my graduate school as I didn't have a stable job yet and had some personal emergencies at the time that needed the money more than my loans. At this time, I do have enough saved to potentially pay off about $5,000 right now, and want to know where it might best be put towards or split. 
 Loans (highest to lowest balance with interest rate):
 - $11,460.77 at 8.08% 
 - $11,143.34 at 8.08%
 - $10,628.76 at 7.94% 
 - $10,316.84 at 7.94%
 - $5,283.10 at 8.08%
 TOTAL: $48,832.81
 Any tips or suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you!

From hospitality workers to retail employees, the exaggerated “customer service voice”, often mocked in internet memes as wildly different from someone’s real voice, has long been a cultural trope. Fast-food giant Burger King is now taking that voice one step further, saying it will detect whether employees are using words like “please” and “thank you” through the assistance of artificial intelligence.
On Thursday, Burger King announced it is rolling out a new AI chatbot connected to employee headsets at hundreds of locations in the US as part of a platform called BK Assistant, powered by OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.

 Oh but that’s before considering the opportunity cost of lost wages from leaving my current job…
 I am set to attend a well-established US MD school, so I’m not that worried about matching residency/finding work once I finish.
 The medical-field subs are all too stuck in a prisoner’s dilemma type situation where nobody will give a straight answer.
 So, personalfinance, how scared should I be of this?

Latest US-Iran nuclear talks conclude with claims of ‘significant progress’

How Trump shifted from opposing foreign wars to threatening war in Iran

The nuclear talks today are the third between the US and Iran since June 2025, when the US joined Israel’s war against Iran and bombed its nuclear and military sites. It effectively ended the US-Iran talks that were held in the weeks prior to the conflict aimed at reaching a nuclear peace agreement.
As before, the negotiations are being mediated by Oman, which has maintained a policy of neutrality and assumed the role of mediator both within the Arabian peninsula and more broadly across the Middle East. The country lies in the centre of tensions between the US and Iran and is directly vulnerable to maritime instability and regional escalation.
If the talks fail, there is uncertainty over what the US may do regarding a possible military attack against Iran, and when it might act. Questions remain over what this could mean for the wider region, with Iran warning it would retaliate and even attack Israel.
The state-run Oman News Agency has posted photos on social media showing the Omani foreign minister Badr Albusaidi sat with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Geneva.

High-stakes talks between the US and Iran over the future of Tehran’s nuclear programme ended on Thursday without a deal, as the White House weighs a military operation that would mark its largest intervention in the Middle East in decades.
The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, claimed “good progress” had been made at the talks and Omani mediators predicted negotiations would reconvene at a technical level next week in Vienna.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my wife and I had $3800 of medical bills go to Collections (PaySCSI), where for the past 12 months or so we have been paying $50/month, paying what we could without it going inactive. Well last month the account was randomly disabled with no notice or warning, and today we received a letter in the mail from a Law Firm Debt Collector trying to collect, stating we owe $3300, and have paid $0 since the origination of the bill. 
 What can we do here? What can the debt collector do? It’s kind of BS that we were paying what we could monthly just for our account to be disabled with no warning, and then be sent to a collector stating we’ve paid nothing towards the debt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel so guilty even thinking about this but my husband has been out of work for 6+ months and the job market is rough. We’ve gone through our savings. I have $20k in credit card debt. We’re working on starting a business that had really tied up our finances even before the job loss, so we’re in a tough spot. I’ve tried to find any other solution and family can’t help. We are at a point where this coming month, we’ll be eating into my limited summer account (the money I put aside to get me through my unpaid summer months as a teacher) and that will only give us about 2 months respite. 
 Here’s my dilemma: I started 529 college accounts for my kids that now hold a combined $34k. My kids are 5 and 7. If I withdraw $20k, I can pay off my credit card debt and free up money from those big monthly payments that are largely going to credit card interest. I know I will take a hit on withdrawing it for noneducational reasons, 10% on earnings. It would leave my kids with $8,400 and $5,600 in their college accounts. 
 Of course my hope is that our business takes off and I can easily replace this money plus some in the next few years. But if I can’t, I know this withdrawal will greatly diminish what those accounts would be otherwise when they graduate high school. I’m sure college is going to be expensive and I’ve been really proud of being able to sock so much away in these accounts. The idea of withdrawing it makes me feel so guilty but I’m really nervous about our situation right now.
 So, should I withdraw the funds to get rid of high interest debt now, freeing up much needed money each month or grit my teeth and keep looking for any other options?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an Indonesian, I've seen people in here find the Malaysian language funny and even some malay words are made into short lived slangs. Especially for it's different pronunciation for the same words ("Apa ini" -> "Ape ni"), ("Siapa" -> "Siape"). And sometimes Malaysians use very old school/formal wordsimore often in casual conversation. 
 However this got me thinking, how do Malaysians view our language vice versa?

What we know so far about the deadly boat shooting off Cuba’s coast

Cuba has vowed to defend itself against any “terrorist and mercenary aggression”, a day after border guards said they had killed four exiles on a Florida-registered speedboat that opened fire on a patrol.
Cuba’s president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, wrote on X that the Caribbean country would “defend itself with determination and firmness” after the incident in which six other people on the boat were injured.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this may not be the best place to go with this question, but it was the first place that I thought of so hopefully y'all can be of some help or direct me to those who would know better.
 Long story short, I think I just had someone attempt to phone scam me, said they were from KeyBank, and I had some odd transactions, a Walmart and Chick-fil-A purchase, plus a scheduled Zelle transfer of $1000. First two were easy to bop off, but the third scheduled Zelle transfer "wasn't so simple". Apparently, to stop this transfer from happening, I had to send a Zelle to the "supervisor" of $1000 with a case number in the memo. That felt all sorts of sketch to me, did a little digging around in the app, couldn't even see the pending send. So I hung up, blocked the two different numbers they kept calling me from, and locked the card for the moment.
 I'm 96.3% sure that was a scam, but I'd just like to here from some others. I just don't see why if it was actually key they couldn't just cancel the transfer, scheduled or not, or why it wouldn't show up in my pending activity.

Denmark’s prime minister has called an early election to take advantage of a “Greenland bounce” after Donald Trump’s threats to invade the Arctic territory.
Mette Frederiksen, who has been in office since 2019, is required by Danish law to call an election by 31 October. Setting a date with eight months to go appears to be an attempt to ride improved poll ratings after disastrous local elections in November that saw her Social Democrats lose control of Copenhagen for the first time in a century.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm 41, and I would love to buy my first home. I am a remote software engineer and have been self-employed (s-corp) for about 2 years, which means I finally have enough income history to apply for a home loan. I make decent money, have no debt, and have a great credit score. I’ve been able to max out my IRA and 401 (k) contributions for the past 2 years. I have a 5% down payment saved in addition to emergency savings that will last me about 6 months at my current rent, but probably only 3-4 months if I take on a mortgage. I do not have a partner or family safety net other than my own savings. I wish I had bought 7 years ago, but that ship has sailed.
 In the last few months, with the new AI models and parallel agents, I've hardly written any code. The shift away from relying on my decade software engineering skills into a more supervisory/planning role for AI agents makes me nervous about my professional future. If I were to lose work, I would only have my savings to fall back on until I find another job—no unemployment insurance.
 My mom lost her job and her home to foreclosure in 2008, and it devastated her. I’ve been very careful with my finances since my own bankruptcy in my early 20s. I finally find myself in a good financial position, albeit with an unknown professional future. I feel like this might finally be my chance to own a home, but that comes with risks. What would you do? Would you take the plunge into home ownership?
 UPDATE:
 Thank you all for the great advice! I am going to keep throwing money into my emergency fund until I have a 12 month buffer at the higher cost of owning. I will to continue to contribute to my Roth IRA, but divert my 401k contributions to the emergency fund for now. I have already been putting the difference between what I anticipate paying for a mortgage and my rent into a separate brokerage account to invest for a down payment. We'll see where I am in a year or two. Grateful for this sub.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live in the Midwest and work for a public university so I’m enrolled in a pension. I began working here at 27 years old and have to put in 32 years to receive my max benefit. The pension payment amount is calculated based on age, years of service credit, and final average salary. 
 The problem that I’m having is the pay. I’m an accountant with a bachelor’s degree. I’ve worked here for 14 months and make $57k. We do NOT receive market adjustments and our yearly raise is a max of 3.5%. We work in the office once/week and every few weeks we have to do twice/week. This is important to me as I live over an hour from the closest major city. 
 I had a preliminary interview for a position this morning that’s offering $60-65k starting out, 5-10% annual raises, and only in the office 2x/month. I’m waiting for the benefits information to be sent over to me, but I believe they match up to 4.5% for the 401k.
 I need advice as to whether leaving a pension is a huge mistake or not, or advice from somebody who has made the transition. My friend just retired after 15 years of service as a senior accountant only making $80k, if that shows how terrible the pay is.

 They asked the top preforming 401ks / accounts (I think top third) in a survey what they were doing to preform so well. The top response was "I don't have an account with fidelity". Aka the best performers are people that just leave there money in market (because they didn't even know they had an account).
 My question is, what happens to these accounts when these people die? Presumably they have no knowledge of their account and so their family would not either. Just curious is there an ever growing top preforming account list that is unclaimed? 
 I know normally a 401k is either part of the estate or the spouse, but it sounds you need to file paperwork to get these accounts...so without knowledge it would never happen

        <updated>2026-02-26T15:13:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen quite a few posts on here about not contributing to a 529 because you might lose aid. The reality is that most aid these days is in the form of federal loans (subsidized if you are lucky) as declining college enrollment is limiting scholarships and hammering college budgets. The good news is that the 529 is a great way to get a discount on college and get compounding growth.
 My son starts college in fall and I looked back today to see how much out of my pocket I would be paying:
 529 Savings: $133,718
 529 Principal: $71904
 So out of my bank account, originally, I put in $71k. I dumped in $1000 the day he was born, and started at $100/mo. Everytime I got a raise I would bump this by $20-$30/mo until I got to $300/mo and as of now I've stopped entirely. I also had this in what my state called Aggressive Age Based portfolio, not the no-risk/low-risk options and the last 15 years of returns really helped.
 Additionally, I got a 4.6% tax benefit on the principal in Colorado which means my real out of pocket was $68,596. This is still a lot of money, but its not so bad over 18 years. And now I probably won't pay anything out of my actual bank account for 4 years in-state and no hope or wishful thinking about "financial aid".
 College isn't for everyone of course, but with the recent tax law changes around IRAs any left over money goes there and anything beyond that I will just hold for future grandkids.
 Edit: one other note. As a parent I am willing to fund 4 years of public college. I saw lots of kids in my high school choose "a pretty campus" and come out of a private school with an English degree and 100k in loans (in 1998). I went to a state engineering school, the campus was ugly, but I learned a lot and didn't pay through the nose. I think kids need to understand ROI even if you are paying. You want to go to Elon or Loyola Marymout? Better get a loan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was billed 210k for an 8 day hospital stay. I just received the itemized billing in my patient portal (not a bill for me but just a reference for me). I have anthem insurance with in network out of pocket max of 5k. Everything should be in network per the insurance company. Out of pocket max for out of network is 10k. Was a pretty serious emergency visit and I needed complex surgery so I’m not entirely surprised. I’ve never been hospitalized and am otherwise young and healthy.
 My question is, since I’ve never had to use my health insurance for anything serious, will they cover this up to my out of pocket max? Or will I have to fight them? My hsa has more than enough for the out of pocket max but obviously I can’t afford 210k.

I check my Venmo account and sure enough $60 had been deducted. I started a dispute (Jan 13th) and Venmo had credited my account (Jan 23rd). February 19th they said that “7ELEVEN-FCTI has provided us with records confirming that this transaction was valid, and that the money was dispensed. Based on the ATM audit tape, we have concluded our investigation.” 
 I’m not sure what the audit tape could say because I never got any money and the atm machine didn’t even make a whirling sound as if it was going to dispense anything. What can I do? Venmo took away $60 from me and the bank has no real customer service just saying if it’s a problem with our atms contact your bank.

What is indisputable, however, is that for several decades investors took major economic, financial and political trends for granted. For a long period beginning in the 1980s, the world was relatively predictable. Many economists dubbed this era “the great moderation”. Others pointed to the impact of...]]></summary>

He’s built up 50k in debt he’s been hiding from me, and has been secretly planning to liquidate his 401k to try to go make things work with his “girl”.
 He’s throwing away our life for a woman who he pays to like him. He fell in love with the stripper.
 How do I protect myself? I live in Puerto Rico. We own the house outright. We’re both on the deed. He hasn’t done anything physical, but I have screenshots of his onlyfans messages and chatGPT transcripts of him saying he’s going to leave me. I don’t want to sell my house.
 Edit: All of our other finances are independent. We’ve been together for 13 years, living in this house we own for 3.
 I’m going to buy him out of his equity. He gets everything he wants. I get to star over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am 25 and I have no clue about finances. I try to save as much as possible and tbh money/financial things overwhelm me to the point I avoid looking into things too much. One of my coworkers did recommend me to Ameriprise and the advisor there wanted to open a brokerage account and do all sorts of stuff. Frankly, that whole conversation was a lot and I still haven’t said yes to it. So I am posting here to push me to learn about finances. Here is a quick background of my finances: making 84k in Texas, do 8% to my 401k for company match of 6%. I have a HSA and started to contribute $40 bucks every paycheck so $80 monthly. I have roughly $54k in savings, $19k in checking , and a Roth IRA with 6k invested and 3k not yet invested. My take home pay after taxes and insurances is $4700, minus rent/card is $2,300. I have no debt but right now I live with my mom and brother and take care of most of our bills due to my mom loosing her job. Within the next year, my goal is to purchase a house and move out but still plan to contribute some towards my mom. So should I max out my Roth IRA for this year since I still have time to contribute? Is Fidelity Go worth it while I figure stuff out ? Should I just invest in one stock like S&P500 or multiple ? How does HSA investing work? Is it the same as a ROTH ?

Advocate for gambling reform reiterates calls for regulator and ban on ads
Reverend Tim Costello, the chief advocate for the Alliance for Gambling Reform, spoke to RN Breakfast this morning about efforts to combat gambling, including the rollout of BetStop, a self-exclusion register.
We are literally saturated. You know, sadly, gambling companies now even own our kids …
Right at the moment, you have the farcical situation that under 16, you can’t be on social media, which I support. But they’re inundated with gambling ads online, on TV. 900,000 of young Australians gambled last year, even though it’s illegal now.

For Andrés Sánchez Barea, in Spain, it was the fear that arose when water started to spurt from plug sockets. For Nelson Duarte, in Portugal, it was the helplessness that hit as violent winds smacked down trees and tore tiles from roofs. For Amal Essuide, in Morocco, it was the reality that dawned when a corpse was pulled onboard a boat in the flooded medina.
Each moment of horror is a fragment of the destruction wrought by an atmospheric machine-gun that in recent weeks has fired storm after storm at the western Mediterranean. Scientists do not know if climate breakdown helped pull the trigger, but research suggests it loaded the chamber with bigger bullets.

 I have one kid and stay in KL right now.
 36 years old
 My assest as below:-
 EPF saving: 280k
 House 1 
 Value: 200k
 Loan : 170k
 House 2
 Value: 400k
 Loan: 260k
 Car
 Value 65k
 Loan 65k
 Investment/trading capital: 332k
 FD/ASBN: 5k
 Debt: 
 personal loan: 70k
 *all these loan are for investment purpose with low interest like 1-2%, can clear out anytime and monthly payment about 3000
 Income:
 Job: 9500 included allowance 
 Trading income: 6000 averages
 Rental income: 1400
 Total: 17900+-
 Monthly expenses:-
 Car 1200
 House 1550(two house)
 Investment house 1400
 Fund to family 700
 Kid 1700 (education and nanny)
 Personal loan 3000
 Insurance 400
 Total: 9950
 I am very very tired for job, almost everyday I thinking want to leave because of politics.
 I understand trading income is not stable, currently I had been stable 6 the income for 6 months which lowest are 2000 and highest are 11000.
 The loan can settle anytime but my trading income would reduce as well, because my trading are base on the fund I having.
 My planning is work and saving more money till June 2026 and resign after. I should have about 350-360k investment fund and getting like average 7k income.
 My thinking is very simple, my trading income is able to cover my expenses if personal loan is clear out, is about 6-7k income vs 6-7k expenses.
 I am plan to baristas fire, maybe become property agent or go study to study and become TCM doctor which I thinking would suit me as no need to fight in cooperate world.
 Can someone give me some tips or advice?
 You can ask me any cruel question to make my mind clear.

The prospects of North Korea-US relations hinge “entirely on the attitude of the United States”, he said on Wednesday. Pyongyang was prepared for both “peaceful coexistence or eternal confrontation” but the choice lay with Washington.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Serious question, not trying to start drama.
 I understand Ramadan is an important and meaningful month for Muslims here. But I’ve always wondered why the reaction toward people eating in public during fasting hours can sometimes be so intense.
 Malaysia isn’t 100% Muslim, and even among Muslims there are valid reasons not to fast like health issues, menstruation, pregnancy, travel, etc. From the outside, we don’t actually know about people’s situation.
 What confuses me more is that sometimes the response goes beyond just disapproval. There have been cases where people were questioned or detained by religious authorities for eating publicly during Ramadan. That makes it feel like it’s treated almost like as a serious public offense even though the person might simply just be non-Muslim or someone with a valid exemption.
 So, what I’m genuinely trying to understand is why does this issue trigger such strong emotional and institutional reactions?
 Is it about public respect? Community identity? Social pressure? Something else?
 I’m asking because I want to understand the social reasoning behind it, not to attack anyone’s beliefs.

 Income:
 Last year I earned about ~$20.4k total:
  
~$12,517 from my tutoring company (1099)
 ~$7,792 from freelance tutoring
 ~$136 from selling items online
  
My monthly income fluctuates a lot:
  
Lowest month: ~$475
 Highest month: ~$2,500
 Typical month: ~$1,000–$2,000 (usually around ~$1,500)
  
I recently started a remote internship with commission (6% per subscriber) and a small marketing budget ($250 that I can keep), so income may increase slightly but will still be variable.
 Taxes:
 I owe self-employment taxes this year (estimate is ~$1,000–$2,000). I can only pay about $500 right no…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning, recently got an offer letter for this position in F&B industry and its my first time in this industry, was wondering what are the benefits usually company offer or employees should entitled to besides EPF, SOSCO and insurance. 
 Details:
 Pay - RM3,600 ( <1 year experience, staff meals provided) 
 Transportation: total around 3-3.5 hours travelling duration by car back and forth during peak hour ( no public transport nearby my area) 
 Cost of driving : around RM10 or less with tols depends on which route waze lead me to. Petrol: around RM500-600 a month
 Parking: RM100-200 per month depends on which building has vancancy
 medical claim: RM500 a year on their specific panels
 The reason why I asked about opinions was the other company I interviewed ( not f&b) has more benefits like gym membership and so on. Is this how traditional f&b company offer?
 Thank you so much for your attention and would be appreciate with all the experienced sifus here!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is this refinance a good deal? 6.325% → 5.49% with \~$2.2k in costs
 Looking for feedback on a refinance offer.
 Current loan:
 Balance: $638,000
 Rate: 6.325%
 30-year fixed
 P&I: \\\~$3,990/month
 No prepayment penalty
 Refi offer:
 Loan amount: $638,000
 30-year fixed
 Rate: 5.49%
 APR: 5.51%
 P&I: $3,618/month
 Lender + third-party costs: $2,187
 Total cash to close (including escrows/prepaids): \\\~$7,200
 Monthly savings on P&I: \\\~$372
 Break-even on hard costs looks like \\\~6 months ($2,187 ÷ $372).
 Questions:
 1. Is 5.49% competitive right now for a 30-year conventional refi? 2. Are $2,187 in lender/third-party fees considered low? 3. Would you lock this or wait and see if rates drop further this year? 4. Anything I should specifically watch out for in the Loan Estimate? 
 Appreciate any feedback

 My 2017 Nissans Sentra transmission is done per my mechanic and a transmission specialist. Used transmission with labor is 3k-ish and new transmission (from Nissan) with labor is around 5k-ish. I still owe like 8.5k on the Nissan. My credit is 720 and growing because I’m still making my monthly payments ( this happened in early Feb). I don’t know if I should put that negative equity into a new car and accumulate a 700 monthly note because I need a car asap. Or to just get a new car and have a 200-300 new car note and just not make payments on my Nissan and send it to collections/repo. I’m in a desperate situation so if anyone has any ideas or tips I would be very appreciative.Idk if this helps in anyway but I’m work in audit make around 75k and live with my family in Va but I’m trying to figure this out since the Nissan is only in my name. Btw F*** cvt transmission I had no idea. But please anything would help. I’ll be very responsive on my post and will provide more information as needed. Thanks and have a blessed night.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cara Perdana Menteri Anwar Ibrahim mengendalikan pelbagai isu, termasuk kes rasuah dan perkara penting bagi golongan progresif serta bukan Melayu, menyebabkan peningkatan rasa kecewa dalam kalangan penyokong teras PH.
 Bagaimanapun, Rafizi Ramli, bekas timbalan presiden PKR yang ditolak dalam pemilihan, memberi isyarat bahawa penyokong PH mungkin mempunyai sesuatu yang boleh dinantikan daripadanya menjelang Jun.
 Dalam temu bual dengan BFM yang disiarkan semalam, Rafizi berkata dia dan sekutunya terbuka untuk "membawa haluan sendiri.
 Ditanya sama ada haluan ini akan melibatkan penubuhan parti, anggota parlimen Pandan itu menjawab bahawa mereka mahu memberi "pilihan" kepada pengundi, terutamanya golongan muda, namun bentuknya hanya akan diputuskan dalam beberapa bulan lagi.
 "Kami sedang melihat angka, kami melihat segala kemungkinan, pelbagai kemungkinan konfigurasi politik. Tetapi saya rasa anda akan mendengar lebih banyak daripada kami selepas Jun.
 "Bagi mereka yang merasakan 'ini sudah berakhir, saya tidak ada pilihan untuk mengundi siapa'... kerana saya rasa begitulah cara saya terjun ke politik pada 1998. Saya mahukan pilihan.
 "Jadi saya mahu memastikan generasi muda terutamanya tidak dinafikan pilihan tersebut," katanya.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a single adult. Since I got my first job 5 years ago, I always give out duit raya to my relatives and random kids coming to the house. Sometimes RM3-10 depending on age. I give out RM10-50 based on situations like if you're in college and I want you to have enough for food haha.
 This year my non Muslim colleagues asked me a question.
 "Is it mandatory to give out money packet when you're not married?"
 I wasn't sure. Pretty sure not. Apparently for Chinese and Indian cultures single people don't give out money packet during CNY or Thaipusam.
 And I suddenly had a thought.
 Why have I been doing this? I thought it's a nice thing to share a bit I have to the kids.
 But some of the adults comments are nasty. "Just RM3/RM5? So kedekut". I only give RM20-RM50 to my younger siblings or kid…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m 45 and still working at my company. My 401(k) has both Pre-tax funds and Mega Backdoor Roth conversions (after-tax money converted to Roth inside the plan).
 My Plan: I want to roll only the Roth portion of my 401(k) into my personal Roth IRA. I plan to leave the Pre-tax 401(k) balance where it is.
 My Goal: I want to move this money to my Roth IRA to get better investment options and easier access to the principal. I’ve read that:
  
IRA Ordering Rules: Unlike a Roth 401(k) (which is pro-rata), a Roth IRA lets me take out my "contributions" first, tax and penalty-free.
 No Penalty: Since my Mega Backdoor conversions were non-taxable (already taxed), I shouldn't owe the 10% penalty for withdrawing that principal from the IRA, even if it's been less than 5 years.
  
Questions:
  
Does the IRS allow a "source-specific" rollover of just the Roth funds (401K Roth to Roth IRA)? Will the answer be different depends on if I am still with the company or not? 
 Once the money is in my Roth IRA, can I really pull the principal out immediately without the 10% penalty?
 Are there any "5-year rule" traps I’m missing by moving Roth 401(k) money to an Roth IRA?

For the first time, a jury will hear testimony this week from a young woman who alleges social media companies intentionally create addictive products, harming children. The witness taking the stand, known by her initials KGM, is the lead plaintiff in an expansive lawsuit against Meta – which owns Instagram and Facebook – and YouTube currently at trial in Los Angeles.
KGM, who is now 20, alleges that she became addicted to social media apps before she was 10 and would spend hours every day scrolling through photos and videos. This led to years of mental health issues, according to her lawyers and court documents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife works as an adjunct professor for a college. She normally picks up 1-2 classes / quarter; these classes are a mix of in-person on campus, teaching the course to high schoolers at a local high schooler, and "synch" (dual online / in person on campus) and depends each semester.
 Shes been doing adjunct for over a year with the same college. They have a main campus about an hour away from us, and a secondary campus about 30 minutes away; the latter is where she teaches out of and technically her adjunct work has all been "through secondary campus."
 The system announced today that the secondary campus was closing and classes for fall quarters were canceled. She's got two classes in Spring that are unaffected and MAYBE two summer classes that are or may not be, but she would not resume with them in the fall because campus would be shut down.
 Given the length of time continuously doing adjunct, can she claim unemployment in the fall, even if it's a very small amount? Even though she is adjunct, she is a W2 employee.

Christina Applegate has revealed that she is now largely confined to her bed, five years after she was diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis.
In an interview with People magazine before the release of her memoir, the 54-year-old actor said she spends a lot of her days in bed due to the pain that comes with movement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m sadly having to put down my old 2005 Lexus with 280k miles due to some unsolvable issues. It kills me because I can’t stand the thought of a car payment. I try to live as frugal as possible maxing out IRA, deferred comp contributions, etc. I figure a lease is a waste of time. I know this might also just be preference as well. 
 I have around 9 months of living expenses in a high yield. I could throw 10k cash at a used well-taken care of vehicle with high mileage…however, that would wipe out nearly 50% of that emergency fund…. Or put down a decent down payment on a 4-5 year old reliable vehicle then throw as much money at it is as I can to lessen the length of financing while still maxing IRA. I’m between being tired of driving around 10-15 year old cars….but then I’m also scared of a car payment. My only debt is my mortgage. Any advice would be awesome 😎

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, looking for some advice.
 A $2.8k collection from Kimball Tirey St. John showed up on my Experian report last December and I honestly don’t recognize it at all. I never got any bill or notice before it appeared.
 I disputed it multiple times (even through CFPB) and it keeps coming back as verified but they never gave me any documentation. I’ve never signed anything or acknowledged this debt.
 So I sent a debt validation letter by certified mail and now I’m just waiting. My main worry is what happens if they don’t respond.
 What should I do next? Should I file another dispute, go back to CFPB, or talk to a consumer attorney?
 Would really appreciate any insight.

The anti-slavery watchdog has called for a complete overhaul of websites advertising sexual services after an investigation revealed they can act as “accelerators” of exploitation for sex workers using them.
While working online can provide enhanced protections for some, a new report from the independent anti-slavery commissioner, Eleanor Lyons, investigated the experiences of women who said they were exploited on the adult services sites, which typically allow users to browse through images and videos of women selling sex in their local area.

Cruel comments, racism and cover-ups: key findings from England’s maternity care report

Hospitals that cause harm and injury to women and babies during childbirth often resort to a “cover-up” of their mistakes, falsify medical records and deny bereaved parents answers, a damning report has found.
“Negligent” care has devastating emotional and psychological consequences for families, disputes between maternity staff have a “disastrous” impact on mothers, and ethnic minority and poorer women have worse outcomes because of racism and discrimination, Lady Amos said.
Banning families from being involved in investigations into the mistakes they encountered.
Conducting inquiries into errors which families think are poor quality and do not properly reflect what occurred.
Driving distressed families to instigate legal action as a way of getting at the truth after they were “denied openness and honesty in the aftermath of harm and bereavement”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are refinancing our mortgage because interest rates are down over a full percentage point from when we bought our house. We've only been in the house for about a year, so consider the 30 year mortgage to still be full term.
 On a principal of $150k, would it be better to take a 20 yr mortgage with 5.375% interest (5.608 APR) or a 30 yr mortgage at 5.75% (5.91 APR) and pay extra to principal equal to the 20 yr loan payment?
 The refinanced 20 yr loan's monthly payments with escrow are only $2 more per month than our current payment on our existing 30 yr loan. The new 30 yr loan would be $129 less per month, without the extra paid to principal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: Single mother. Got laid off from my teaching position last year and only found part time work as a tutor this year. Then my child’s father passed away so I lost child support (getting survivor benefits now, but it still set me back). I nearly lost my car to repossession, nearly lost auto insurance, and I’m 2-4 payments behind on all of my credit cards. No savings.
 Current: With my daughter’s SS payments, our rent and groceries should be paid for going forward. But I’m still behind on everything else except the car and barely in the black. Because I went from full time to part time, I got a huge amount back on my tax refund. Over $10k. I first paid back family I had borrow money from these past few months, so that was around $3k. I have about 7k left to set myself up for success here. I’ll save $1k for an emergency fund, so that’s $6k left.
 Hopefully I will find a full time job next year, but this summer I won’t have a consistent income at all (unless I get a summer school position, which I have applied for).
 Question: I have about $10k in high interest credit card debt spread across four cards. My worst one is $5k. $200 monthly payment. 29% interest. Currently four months behind but started a payment plan. Obviously I could just pay that entire amount off now.
 But I also have a shitty 2014 Kia Soul with $4k left to pay it off. It costs me $220 a month in car payments at 12% interest, plus $200 in full coverage insurance. Part of me wants to pay this off first because when I get behind they threaten to repossess it, and I would be so fucked if that happened. I think I’d also reduce my insurance coverage to save money there.
 Obviously the credit card has a higher interest rate, but paying off the car would give me more security over the next few months until I (hopefully) find full time work.
 Then again, I could pay off the card first, and apply that extra $200 to my car to pay it off faster but not if I can’t find steady summer work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[we have been in our home 3 years and thought we needed a full appraisal to remove our PMI. we waited until we finished our basement to make sure we had enough equity in the home to hit the 80% LTV.
 our mortgage company offered to use an appraisal or Brokers price opinion. we chose a BPO for the sake of saving money and don’t plan to sell or refinance soon.
 the guy doing our BPO was a realtor that saw 15 houses the day he came to ours. he whipped through took pictures and asked us what we needed value wise to hit 80% LTV. he didn’t really seem to care much and just wanted his money.
 our appraisal came in much higher than what we asked for and needed ~200k more (which is what we kind of thought our home was worth given similar comps.)
 totally suggest you doing this. we only had $60 PMI but it paid for myself within 3 months and will save quite a bit over the next couple years.
 highly suggest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, hoping to get some honest perspectives.
 My partner and I are a dual income couple (30s) with combined net household income around RM16k per month.
 We currently own one condo (under one name) with an outstanding loan around mid-300k. Instalment is about RM1.5k per month and we’re planning to rent it out this year. Expected rent should roughly cover the instalment.
 We are currently renting a place for 1.4k monthly. We’re now considering buying a landed home for own stay, price around RM930k to 1m.
 Plan is:
 • New landed under the other partner’s single name (lower income)
 • 35-year loan
 • Instalment estimated around low RM4k range
 • No other major commitments, no kids. Our average monthly expenses are about RM9k.
 Main concerns:
 • Is this too aggressive for our income level?
 • Would you wait longer before committing to a landed at this price?
 Appreciate any real life experiences, especially from those juggling mortgage + rental at the same time.
 Thanks in advance.
 TLDR:
 Early 30s couple, RM16k combined net income, holding 1 condo, considering RM930k landed under single name. Rent or buy? We welcome some slaps in the face.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for practical advice.
 Household of 3 in NJ. I’m currently unemployed. Wife and 17-year-old son both work part-time. Combined gross income is about $3,900/month.
 Monthly expenses are around $4,000 (rent alone is $2,800), so we’re running slightly negative and using savings to cover the gap.
 We currently have:
  
~$42k in cash
 ~$36k in brokerage
 Retirement accounts that I know typically don’t count for SNAP
  
Technically, our income is under NJ’s gross income limit for 3 people. But with ~$75–80k in liquid assets, I’m assuming approval is unlikely.
 My question isn’t “should I rely on benefits long term.” It’s more:
 Would you apply for SNAP temporarily to slow the savings burn while job searching?
 Or is that unrealistic given asset levels?
 Just trying to think strategically and make a smart move.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I’m 22 and just graduated college. I recently started working as a Third Mate with Military Sealift Command (federal civilian mariner). My projected net income starting out should be around $150k–$180k per year depending on overtime.
 I plan on maxing out my Roth IRA and my TSP annually. I’ll also be upgrading my license as I continue sailing, which should increase my earning potential over time.
 One unique factor: I’ll be at sea about 4–8 months per year, so my living expenses are extremely low. I don’t have a car payment, rent, or major recurring expenses while sailing (housing, food, etc. are covered onboard).
 I’m trying to be intentional early and set myself up for financial freedom. Beyond maxing retirement accounts, what else should I be thinking about?
 • Tax strategies? • Brokerage investing? • Real estate? • HYSA vs money market? • Anything 
 Appreciate any insight — especially from people who started young and high-earning.

The Spanish officer who led his armed followers into the Spanish congress in a failed military coup in 1981 has died on the same day that the socialist-led government declassified documents relating to the murky attempt to overthrow the country’s post-Franco democracy.
Antonio Tejero, who died aged 93, was part of a network of rightwing police and military officers whose efforts to seize power were thwarted after King Juan Carlos refused to support the coup and ordered the generals to obey the democratic constitutional order.

The deadly toll on journalists in the Gaza war

A record 129 journalists and media workers were killed in the course of their work in 2025, two-thirds of them by Israeli forces, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).
It was the second consecutive year in which killings of members of the press reached unprecedented levels, and the second year running in which Israel was responsible for roughly two-thirds of the total, the New York-based independent organisation, which documents attacks on journalists worldwide, said in its annual report published on Wednesday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone
 I’m asking for advice from people who have actually lived or studied in Malaysia, especially in Alor Setar.
 My cousin from Yemen received a fully funded scholarship to Albukhary International University (AIU) in Alor Setar. The scholarship covers:
 Full tuition
 On-campus accommodation
 Free campus Wi-Fi
 RM 400 monthly allowance
 Her family is low income. Realistically, her mother can only send an additional USD 100–150 per month.
 So in total, she would have roughly RM 830–1,050 per month for food, transport, phone, personal expenses, etc. (since accommodation and internet are covered).
 But we are worried about:
 Is this amount realistically enough in Alor Setar?
 What do students there actually spend monthly (without rent)?
 Are there hidden costs we should expect?
 How expensive is food near AIU?
 Is RM 800-1,000/month manageable or extremely stressful?
 This is a huge opportunity for her to leave Yemen and study abroad, so we don’t want her to reject it because of fear but we also don’t want her to struggle badly financially.
 If you’ve studied in Alor Setar (or Kedah), especially as an international student, could you share your real monthly spending and whether this budget is feasible?
 Thank you so much. Honest answers are appreciated.

 I realized I have the option online to contribute from my bank to last year’s contribution limit. Is there any downside to this other than the fact it’s after tax money?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I have a decent job currently making 75k USD a year. I’m from Canada but currently work in the US. I have a masters degree and about 3 years out into the industry from when I graduated. I have 2 roommates which brings the cost of rent down significantly. However I live in a city with a very high COL (nyc). Additionally, I have a significant student loan debt of $77k CAD. Thankfully in Canada this has no interest, but I will be paying $420 CAD (~$310 USD) monthly for the next 14 years (started paying last year).
 That being said, I currently don’t have any savings, 401k, or any investments (stocks, etc.). I need help but don’t know where to start. I have some credit card debt but very insignificant, so really it’s just the student loans. I do not own a car as I live in nyc. I’m currently taking my licensure exams (I’m in the architecture field) and I have 2/4 more to go and once I get licensed I will have more opportunities for higher positions with significantly better pay. I think I’m on an okay path but I’m anxious about not having any savings.
 What can I do? Where do I start? I never learned anything about money growing up so you can say I am pretty financially illiterate, and I have made some mistakes I in terms of living above my means and partying a lot during my 20s, but I have adjusted my lifestyle since (moved to a cheaper apartment with roommates, limit going out, cooking at home vs eating out & delivery)
 Thank you in advance

 Just wondering if anyone has experience with the process of renouncing their passport in Malaysia. 
 I have gained my British citizenship, is in UK currently and will return to KL next month. 
 I am thinking to enter Malaysia with British passport and mention I will be renouncing once I enter Malaysia. 
 Or should I enter with Malaysian passport for ease and renounce later, will this affect me when leaving Malaysia with my British passport?
 Any advice will be much appreciated. Thank you.

 I plan to put some money for the 2025 contributions. My question is how would I know I am over the max salary for a single income person? I know it is 150k for 2025. I make a little under 110k a year (pre tax), I have a hysa, and I contribute around 10 percent of my paycheck to my traditional 401k through my company.
 My next question would be, if I ever go over the max salary to contribute to a roth ira, what happens to the money that I contributed and earned before I made over the max salary?
 Thank you!

 Context:
 23M, Final Sem college major in international business, quite poor cgpa (2.9), with rm65k in savings. i have ptptn (govn loan) about rm25k.
 Yap:
 I come from a normal family, been saving since young and i dont spend on anything. i used to put my money in FD (fixed deposit), but im wondering if there's better ways to use it. im also unsure what my future holds, as i dont have any direction on what i want work for in the future. 
 I have done my internship at a medium size company as a BD (businmess development intern), basically a fancy word for sales, but they never allowed me to do sales because i was an intern. I mostly learn through observation, attending meetings, understanding bsuiness flows and structure, key in numbers, abit of excel, proposal, slides, and attending event.
 Part-time working experience outside of internship:
 promoter (promote beverage), biscuit factory worker (making them and packaging), warehouse work (apply stickers), and some event management (setting up booths). My hometown does those mooncake and other biscuit related work and i go help out whenver i visit hometown since young.
 Rant:
 My struggle is that, i dont think im good at anyting, and i havent identified any strengths. i have barely any practical skills that companies probably ask for, like whats your proficiency in something something, working in some auto pilot jobs doesnt really help alot lol. 
 Thank you for reading, and sorry for the long rant. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Im also looking for some ppl to chat with, tho im not very active here.. Im chopped af

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year I’m unfucking myself and taking my finances more seriously than prior years.
 For context, I don’t mean I was stupid with money, I’ve always been told I’m great at considering expenses and costs and saving money since I was extremely young (grew up lower class) but I always pushed off things like a Roth IRA and making other accounts as I felt like I was too busy and I had plenty of time. Now I’m suddenly ready to start taking it all seriously.
 I’ve started two of my goals already. One being putting $50 into my Roth IRA account each week along with buying $50 of stock every-time I want To buy something useless, and the other being starting to put $400 a week towards my car payment to be debt free by Christmas. (I don’t pay rent with family but want to simulate somewhat of what it would be like to have to have a $1600 a month expense.
 This being said, another item I want to start with is saving smartly. I hear nonstop about HYSA and I can’t figure out which would be the best for me (I wasn’t ease of use and most security). I have $6400 currently sitting in savings collecting dust so I would put that directly into the account. 
 Any recommendations?

The US has been accused of “shameless exploitation” over a health financing agreement with Zambia worth more than $1bn (£740m), amid warnings that the country is getting a raw deal from the Trump administration.
A leaked draft of a five-year memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the two countries, seen by the Guardian, reveals that Zambia may accept terms worse than health financing agreements the US has reached with 16 other African countries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To provide relevant details by April I’ll be working a total of 3years in my company, with 2.5 of those being 2x interns and part-time whilst studying. I work as a AI/DevOps/Data Engineer.
 Edit: 22years old
 Intern1: Rm1000
 Part-time1: 11rm/h
 Intern2: 1800
 Part-time2: 4500 prorated (average 100-120hours around 2.5-3.5k)
 Conversion to full time: October 5000.
 Increment1(today): 5500 (expected was 6000-6500)
 Why I felt I deserved much more is that I’m essentially doing the roles of 2.5 individuals I replaced a member who left whilst retaining my current work. I’m not “overworked”/stressed as I’m very efficient. My work has contributed to the company gaining a 7figure grant last year as well.
 I know I’m still young but my KPI is one of the highest and my work in DevOps and Ai would easily get me 40-60% someone else. I’ve already have potential offers at 6-7k but staying until this grant is done for my portfolio.
 I feel quite discouraged and whether I’m being spoiled or not.

Members of Iran’s ruling elite have been accused of brazen hypocrisy by allegedly using the state’s wealth to help to fund their adult children’s lives in the west while presiding over growing economic misery and repression at home.
Opposition campaigners made the accusation against some of the clerical regime’s most powerful figures as a military confrontation with the US appears increasingly likely. Donald Trump has deployed a vast armada in the Middle East and confirmed he is considering strikes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On January 12, 2026, Sunway launched a bold RM11 billion offer to take over IJM, a move designed to create one of Malaysia’s largest construction powerhouses to rival Gamuda. Despite a subsequent MACC investigation into an alleged RM2.5 billion money-laundering case involving IJM’s management, Sunway has reaffirmed its commitment to the deal. This takeover represents a high-stakes clash between two different corporate DNA structures: the founder-led agility of Sunway and the institution-backed stability of IJM, which is largely owned by funds like EPF and PNB.

 I stumbled upon SA's pop up notification and saw that all their ETFs are flat 1.99USD (SST not included) per order (new money in / withdrawal) with no AUM based management fees applied. Dividends are reinvested for free. FX rates are advertised at 0.35% spread.
 I was wondering how does this fare vs IBKR or Moomoo or even Webull. Anyone with deep knowledge for the minor fees etc can clarify because long term these add up.
 Edit: To top up, investment would be around RM12k every 6 months, long term investment (10yrs upwards)

 The High Court today jailed a businessman for four months after revising a magistrates’ court’s sentence for the assault of a senior citizen last month, an incident which went viral after being captured on video.
 Judge Aslam Zainuddin imposed the custodial term on Saiful Adli Yusof, 52, in a revision hearing involving two charges of voluntarily causing hurt and criminal intimidation against Liew Khoon Foo, 70.
 The court invoked Section 323 of the Criminal Procedure Code and set aside the RM5,000 fine imposed by the magistrate on Feb 10.
 “You are sentenced to four months’ imprisonment from today. For both charges, the sentences are to run concurrently,” the judge said.
 In delivering his decision, Aslam held that Saiful’s conduct was unjustified and had serious consequences.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently started an IBKR account, the initial plan was in VWRA only and chill, but I found some stocks that I believe to be of good value in the US and France.
 How do taxes on capital gains (especially this) and dividends apply in this case? I have never filled taxes before, if I sold my stocks and left them in my IBKR account would that mean I don’t get capital gains taxed?
 Does IBKR handle the dividend tax/capital gains tax side of things automatically by sending information to LHDN (since they have my TIN)?
 I am loss on this.

I think like a lot of folks on this sub, I have financial trauma (grew up in a household with limited funds, parent was in severe debt, didn't really have any models for managing money). I feel very vulnerable typing all of this, but I know talking about money is important practice.
 Trying to keep this brief while providing context—please let me know if I'm missing anything.
 Recent picture: I got laid off two years ago. I received some severance and then got unemployment. With encouragement from my partner, I decided to return to school to finally finish my undergraduate degree—I'm due to graduate this May. Partner is supporting me, but they also just got laid off and is now freelancing.

Sign up for the Breaking News US email to get newsletter alerts in your inbox

Marco Rubio delivered a rare briefing to top US lawmakers on Iran, just a few hours before Donald Trump used his State of the Union address to say that Tehran would never be allowed to develop nuclear weapons.
Amid the largest deployment of aircraft and warships to the Middle East since the 2003 buildup to the Iraq war, Trump said he wanted to solve the confrontation with Iran through diplomatic means while claiming that Tehran was seeking to develop ballistic missiles that could reach the US, without providing further details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, please be patient with me — I’m not a great writer.
 Recently I was in an accident and received some lawsuit money. It’s not millions or anything, but it’s a good amount and honestly I have no idea what to do with it besides maybe saving it for a rainy day or putting it in a high-yield savings account.
 I was really happy when I found out, but I also feel like I can’t tell anyone in real life because last time I had money, people started asking me for help and I ended up broke. When I turned 18 something similar happened and within a year I gave a lot away to family and spent a lot partying with friends. I always told myself if I ever got another chance, I’d do better.
 Right now I’ve managed to save about $10k on my own (mostly through Acorns), and this payout will add about another $20k. I do have around $40k in student loan debt and I’m going back to school soon.
 Part of me wants to just disappear, save it, maybe travel a little and keep the rest safe… but I really don’t trust my own money decisions yet.
 Funny enough, before this happened I kept telling myself I was already rich in spirit and doing a lot of “money manifestation” mindset work. My goal this year was to reach $100k net worth and this payout basically got me about 30% of the way there, which makes me really happy. At the same time, it kind of sucks because I feel like I can’t really tell anyone in my real life without it turning into people asking me for money.
 If you were in my situation, what would you do first?
 Serious advice only please :)
 TLDR: Accident → payout → suddenly responsible adult with ~$30k and no clue what to do. Previously bad at money, currently trying not to financially self-destruct. Help!

From Harvey Stockwin
The Philippine capital Manila was last night (February 24, 1986) in revolutionary turmoil as a people’s government led by Corazon Aquino sought to take over the country backed by a massive demonstration of non-violence by hundreds of thousands of unarmed supporters.
But President Ferdinand Marcos clung to the illusion that he is still in control.

South Korea recorded 254,500 births in 2025, the largest annual increase in 15 years, driven largely by a temporarily enlarged generation – known as “echo boomers” – now in their early thirties, alongside marriage rates recovering from Covid-era delays.
The country’s fertility rate – the average number of babies a woman is expected to have in her lifetime – rose to 0.80 from 0.75 last year, returning to the 0.8 range for the first time since 2021, according to provisional figures released by South Korea’s ministry of data and statistics on Wednesday.

As dozens of their colleagues boycotted Trump’s State of the Union address, several of the Democrats in the House chamber on Tuesday night made their opposition to the president’s remarks clear.
Congressman Al Green was ejected from the speech almost immediately, marking the second year in a row he has been removed from the annual event. After being ordered out by House speaker Mike Johnson during last year’s speech for yelling responses as the president spoke, this year’s protest from the Texas representative was silent but pointed.

We joined work in the same time and our job has a stable increment through out the career (RM200 per year) She and I both right now earn Rm3400 and next year our property will be completed.

 Right now other loans include only our cars (RM500) each.
 SORRY GUYS. ITS RM2500 in total not EACH
 TLDR: Couple earning RM7800 combined, RM3500 fixed loans starting next year. Guaranteed RM200/year increment each until retirement. Best strategy?

Anthony Albanese was evacuated from his official Canberra residence on Tuesday night as police responded to a bomb threat made against him in relation to upcoming performances of the Chinese group Shen Yun.
A spokesperson for Falun Dafa – a group associated with Shen Yun - told Guardian Australia that one of their colleagues had received two threats in recent weeks, written in Chinese, threatening harm against Albanese if the performances went ahead. The threats, the second of which was received this week, were reported to the Australian Federal Police and are thought to have been the reason for the prime minister to be evacuated from the Lodge and the house to be searched by officers.

Donald Trump proclaimed his first year in office a success at the State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, even as his presidency is dogged by low public approval ratings before November’s midterm elections in which voters could hand control of Congress back to his Democratic opponents.
The annual address to a joint session of Congress came after months of turmoil for the Republican president, including a crackdown on immigrant communities in Minneapolis that resulted in the deaths of two US citizens, and faltering progress on his campaign promise of lowering the cost of living.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently living in 800 sq foot house with my wife and newborn baby. Quickly outgrowing the house, we are on 14 acres and the house, as well as the lot are paid off. This puts us in a good position and we are planning to put an extension on the house at around 1300 square feet with a full basement foundation. Unfortunately the quote came back at around 450k with everything included (we are in a very expensive area of upstate NY) and Im starting to wonder if this is the best option? We could buy a house in the area around that same price but we would be sacrificing a lot in terms of peace and quiet and everything we have built up on the acreage. Another option would be to subdivide the lot and start over and build a new, bigger house on the existing lot and rent out the house we are currently living in but the enormity of that project starting from scratch is a bit daunting. Any suggestions and advice would be much appreciated!!

NSW police will patrol high-profile public buildings, places of worship and protests with long-arm firearms after a unit created following the Bondi beach terror attack became permanent.
But the state Greens have criticised the Minns government for the move, saying it would not prevent the public from protesting and may place them at greater risk of harm or violence. Violence at a protest in Sydney against Israeli president Isaac Herzog’s controversial visit earlier this month promoted an independent probe into police conduct.

State of the Union address - live updates

Democrats held competing events on the evening of the State of the Union address across Washington where lawmakers boycotted the official event and protesters said they wanted to show the growing opposition to Donald Trump’s increasingly unpopular agenda.
On the National Mall, hundreds of people, including about 30 Democratic members of Congress, gathered for the “People’s State of the Union”, a counter-rally. Attendees held signs that read “No Money for ICE” and “Healthcare Not Warfare”. One person on stage carried a large poster with the photographs of the more than 30 people who had been killed in dealings with ICE since Trump took office in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, hope everyone survived last night’s warzone
 Lately I’ve been wondering, has anyone noticed how almost every road now has a new condo project coming up? Around my place in Jalan Kuching, it feels like the whole area is transforming into a full-blown metropolis. There’s an MRT station being built nearby, plus more hotels and high-rise residences.
 What honestly bothers me isn’t development itself, I understand cities grow. It’s more about how much greenery we’re losing in the process. It used to be a place filled with trees and nature. When I played futsal, I could actually hear birds in the background. Soon, I’ll probably just hear the train passing by.
 Another thing I don’t quite understand is the planning. Companies seems to be launching condo projects everywhere, yet the roads and traffic conditions don’t seem to improve at the same pace. And regarding the new MRT station, we already have two MRT stations about 10–15 minutes away. Wouldn’t it make more sense to improve bus connectivity to those existing stations instead of building another one so close?
 I’m not against progress, but I do wonder if we’re balancing development, infrastructure, and quality of life properly.
 Just sharing some thoughts curious to hear what you guys think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies from the start if this is not the correct place.
 If I recently took out an auto loan for $17,400 on Feb 2. My first bill was for April 16th for 286$
 I paid $1,000 on Feb 12th and this went directly to the principal and interest. 
 My goal originally was to pay 1k total each payment so $286 regular payment +714$ directly to principal each month. I was planning on doing this for 6 months than refinancing.
 However when I paid my first 1k, they pushed my first bill date back 3 months. My first payment is now not due till July. I called and asked and the money did go directly to my principal but they gave me a grace period for good will or something (I suspect this is to make it seem like I don't have to pay my bill so they make interest)
 Thanks to my tax return and a bonus at work, I was able to pay another 2k directly towards the principal minus the 15.81$ interest (Over only like 5 days man do I hate interest) 
 My question is if I want to refinance when would be the best time to do it.
 My current loan is 13,490$ of the 17,400. 
 I want to get a rate that is around 3-4% and shorten the length to about 36 months so I can just go to regular payments and not worry about the interest. While I can make the extra 714$ payment, it is not exactly comfortable.
 Should I just continue this schedule of paying 1k to my principal each month and pay a total of around 900-1,000 interest.
 Or should I look into refinancing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just got my bonus and tax return, which amounted to about $24,000 I moved $10,000 into my emergency fund which is a HYSA invested in SGOV bringing the emergency fund to $60,500 total. 
 So I have about $14,000 leftover and I'm trying to think of what I should do with it.
 For context on our finances, I make $168k and my wife makes $92k. 
  
We contribute to 401k to get max contributions from employer
 We both contribute to a ROTH IRA up to the yearly max
 We contribute ~$200/month per kid (3 kids) to their 529's.
 I contribute max contributions to a HSA
 We have no car loans and no credit card debt. We have a mortgage and HELOC which combine for about $3500/month. 
  
We do have a solar loan with about $5k on it at 4.99% interest from solar panels we had put on the house. 
 I'm thinking of maybe paying that off, but I'd also like to replace the carpet on our second floor with hardwood which would be about $9000 if I do the whole thing in one shot. It's the last big thing we need to do inside the house.
 We don't really willy-nilly make massive purchases like that but I feel like we're in a good spot to do so. But part of me is like should I just put 5k or 6k towards the principal on the HELOC or something.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! I’ll be relocating to Malaysia soon with my family for work. My office will be in Bandar Bukit Raja, and I’m considering living in one of these areas:
 • Damansara Heights
 • Mont Kiara
 • Desa ParkCity
 I know Klang Valley traffic can be intense, but I’m trying to understand what a realistic daily commute looks like. I need to be at the office by 8:30 AM.
 When I check Google Maps for public transport, it tells me I’d need to leave 9 hours earlier, which I’m assuming is because it doesn’t know the actual bus/train options for that route. My prefer option would be by car, but I’m not sure if the 40 minutes is realistic
 For those who live in these areas or commute toward Klang/Bukit Raja:
 • How long would the drive take if I leave around 7:45 :
 • Is public transport even a viable option I
 for this route
 • Any tips on the best roads or timing to avoid the worst jams
 Thanks in advance , any local insight would really help me plan!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context: I'm 24, I bought a car from CarMax at 22 because I was planning to give my little sister my college car for when she was in college. Long story short, was barely making over 50k, terrible credit profile (lot of debt, 650 score), took a loan at 14.6% (be gentle I know it's dumb). I can afford the payments and it doesn't strain me, so if the answer for now is yes, so be it. I'm currently paying $680 a month on CC debt (fixing terrible profile) and have a ~135% LTV on my car based off KBB. I now make 80k and have a 750-760 credit score based on where you look.
 Anyway, like the title says, am I stuck in the loan for now? I'm going to be CC Debt free in Augustish. Would that be good enough to be able to get a good refi? I just want to either keep payments the same and be done way sooner, or save a few hundred bucks a month to put in a Roth IRA. What should I be planning to do here?

Wales’s Senedd has voted in favour of implementing Westminster’s assisted dying bill, overcoming a constitutionally awkward situation that could have forced terminally ill people who wish to end their lives to travel to England or seek private provision.
In a debate stretching into Tuesday night in the Senedd’s newly expanded chamber, members voted 28 for and 23 against, with two abstentions. Should the legislation pass the House of Lords, the matter will require another Senedd vote after May’s Welsh elections.

 I called the finance department at the hospital and they offered 70% off the bill if I pay the remainder in full right away. Should I take it? Or can I ask for 90% off? Any advice on negotiating with hospital?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, looking for budgeting/debt advice. plz don't judge the interest rate on the car, I already know it wasn't the smartest choice, would rather not be grilled for something I already grilled myself over.
 I’m 22 and active duty Navy. Total debt is around $28k:
  
~$16k student loans (currently in deferment)
 ~$9k car loan (very high interest rate (~29%), credit score ~560)
 ~$950 Discover (charged off ~2 years ago)
 ~$2,100 personal loan (charged off ~2 years ago)
 $300 unsecured credit card (paid in full monthly)
  
I’m about to receive a $30k bonus. My plan is to immediately pay off the $9k car loan because the interest rate is crazy high. That would leave me with about $21k.
 Monthly situation:
  
Take home: ~$2,500 (after 10% to TSP)
 Save: ~$400/month (Factored in take home pay)
 Car insurance: $200/month
 Subscriptions: <$60/month
 No rent
  
Main questions:
  
After paying off the car, should I wipe out the student loans? I'd rather just pay them off monthly instead of 16k all upfront especially as there's no large impact and I'll be making significantly more money in two years from now when they are no longer deferred
 Should I try to settle the two charged-off accounts even though I haven’t heard anything in years?
 Or is it smarter to build a large emergency fund first?
 What would help my credit score the most over the next 1–2 years?
  
Goals are to clean this up, improve my credit, and set myself up to buy a house in a few years. I know I made mistakes early on — just trying to make a smart move with this bonus instead of blowing it.
 Appreciate any advice.
 Edit: First and foremost thanks you to everyone who commented and reviewed my post!! I feel pretty confident now that I can make an informed decision going forward!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I really need some guidance with my finances. For context, six months ago my Mom and Dad passed away quite suddenly in a car accident. Last week, I received my inheritance of about 150k (they both had very large life insurance policies through the military). 
 I truly don't know what to do with this and I don't have any family to ask for help. I'm only 22 and a first year teacher.
 For more context, I don't have any student loans (I worked my way through university), and I paid off my car 3 months ago. So, I don't have any debt. I live modestly in a small 1 bedroom apartment. My budget is tight, but not unmanageable. 
 I've never had this kind of money before and don't know what to do next. I grew up very poor and never received any financial education. The check has just been sitting in its envelope since I got it. Honestly, having the money just feels really shitty and the grief makes it hard to think about clearly.
 I want to put it somewhere it can grow and I still have access to liquidate, I'm just unsure of what that would be. Any help or guidance would be so appreciated. Thank you all. Sorry for the long post!

Brazil’s supreme court has opened the trial of politicians accused of ordering the 2018 murder of Rio de Janeiro councillor Marielle Franco, a case that exposed deep ties between politics and organised crime in the city.
Franco, an activist who grew up in a favela and became an outspoken critic of Rio’s powerful militia groups, was 38 when she was shot dead in the city centre alongside her driver, Anderson Gomes.

The president of the Louvre in Paris has resigned, four months after a gang of thieves broke into the museum’s Apollo gallery and made off with €88m (£76m) of Napoleonic jewellery in France’s most dramatic heist in decades.
Laurence des Cars, who had offered to step down in the immediate aftermath of the burglary, tendered her resignation to Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday in what the French president called “an act of responsibility”, the Elysée Palace said.

“So there must be no place in the free world for Russian oil, for Russian tankers, Russian banks, Russian sanctions …, schemes, or for any Russian war criminals. The time has come to fully ban all participants in Russia’s aggression from entire Europe.”

Violence in Mexico after military kills notorious drug cartel boss – a visual guide

Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has said that there is “no risk” for visitors coming to Fifa World Cup games scheduled to be held in the country, after the death of a top cartel boss triggered a wave of retaliatory violence from gunmen who blocked roads and attacked security forces across the country.
The Mexican military attempted to detain “El Mencho”, the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, in a dawn raid on Sunday, leading to a firefight in which he was fatally wounded, before dying while being airlifted to hospital.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forgive me if there is an obvious answer to this question;
 We started a new mortgage in August: $438,000 over 30yr at 6.624%. In 2023 and 2024, we made too much to qualify for Roth IRA contributions, but in 2025 we are under the threshold. Is it better to max out our Roth IRAs for 2025 or to put that money toward paying down our principal?
 We will hopefully refinance sometime in 2026 once rates drop a bit more, but even with that, I would love to have my house paid off by the time my oldest child starts college (about 10 years from now). For reference, I already contribute 10% of my income to 401k, and between all retirement accounts we have about $300k saved. We probably won't retire until 2055 or so.

Plainclothes police and security forces, many of them armed, have tried to flood Iran’s remaining open universities in an attempt to crush a fourth day of student protests against the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei.
Running battles were reported on some campuses, with videos showing fistfights between the Basji state-backed militia and students at the University of Science and Technology in Tehran. Pick-up trucks with machine-guns were photographed parked outside the University of Tehran, with demonstrations also in Mashhad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been researching investing in US ETFs (mainly VOO and VXUS) from Malaysia and wanted to get insights from people who are already doing it.
 Based on what I’ve learned so far:
 • MYR investors face two moving factors: ETF performance + MYR/USD exchange rate
 • VXUS tends to perform better during weaker USD cycles, while USD strength can cushion losses during downturns
 • Currency swings usually matter more short term than long term
 • Trying to time FX movements seems nearly impossible
 • Many sources recommend DCA and building USD exposure gradually
 • Keeping a small USD buffer helps avoid converting at bad rates and allows buying during dips
 Where I’m unsure:
  
Do you convert in large chunks or DCA into USD over time?
 
How much do exchange rates actually impact your long-term returns?
 
Did you ever regret converting at a “bad” rate, or does it average out?
 
Any mistakes you made when starting US investing from Malaysia?
 
Do you pay attention to FX cycles at all, or just ignore and stay invested?
 
 Would really appreciate hearing real experiences, especially from those who have been investing through different USD/MYR cycles.

The Royal Artillery is facing criticism after it emerged they are refusing public access to an “extraordinary object” looted by the British army in the 19th century from the Asante people in modern-day Ghana.
The glistening golden ram’s head would seemingly be worthy of any museum, but it remains hidden within the regiment’s mess at Larkhill in Wiltshire.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[中国江西九江一名 00 后大学毕业生张瑾，以每月 200 元（约 113 令吉）租住养老院单间，并持续当志愿服务两年多，在网络引发关注。 综合媒体报导，张瑾于 2023 前往苏州工作，一次偶然刷手机时看到一则养老院招募志愿者的推文，内容写道：「年轻人为老人提供陪伴、娱乐、教学，就能以 200、300 元的月租入住养老院」。当时面临房租压力和独居的孤独感，加上养老院距离公司不远，便抱着试一试的心态报名，没想到一住，就爱上这里的生活。 张瑾周一至周五照常到公司上班，到了周末会在养老院当志工。她目前住在一个二十多平米的单间里，房间以原木风为主调，布置温馨舒适。她透露，在苏州正常租住普通房间，每月租金约 2000 元（约 1129 令吉），几乎占自己收入的一半。过去租房还需要父母补贴一点生活费，如今住进养老院后，房租压力大幅减轻。 她坦言，选择入住的原因之一是可享房租减免政策，另一个原因则是觉得很新颖、很好奇。自己刚到苏州时没有太多亲友，在养老院的生活不仅丰富了业余时间，也让她感受到亲人般的温暖，比职场更治愈人心。 据了解，该养老院的招聘条件，要求志愿者年龄必须在 35 岁以下、在苏州没有房子，并具备一定特长或爱好。当时共有 40-50 人报名，最终录取了 5 人。其志愿服务内容，主打一个倾听、一个陪伴，给老人家们提供情绪价值。 张瑾每个季度需完成 45 小时，每周平均不到 4 小时的志愿服务，内容包括陪老人聊天、组织活动、教手指舞和参与文娱互动等。完成规定时数后，可持续享 200 元月租。 她表示，与老人相处的氛围简单但真诚。在公司付出未必能获得肯定，但与老人们相处，无论做什么事，他们都会夸赞或表达感谢，从中收获的情感回馈远超过房租优惠。老人们的关心和陪伴，让她在异乡不再孤单，这种温暖是金钱买不到的。通过与长者相处，也让她学到了很多人生道理，变得更加成熟和坚强。 如今两年多过去，当初同时入选的几名年轻人因婚恋或工作变动陆续搬离，目前仅剩她一人继续居住。张瑾现在仍一边上班，一边从事志愿服务，暂无搬离打算，以后会根据未来职业和生活安排再作决定。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在马来西亚，舞狮不仅是节庆表演，更是一种陪伴我们长大的文化记忆。无论是新年开工、开张志庆，还是庙会巡游，总能看到醒狮队伍浩浩荡荡出发。而许多舞狮团平日出队时，都会乘坐罗里「lori」前往表演地点，这样的画面，对不少人来说早已司空见惯。 不过，近期一名网友却在 Facebook 发文诉苦被警察开 Saman！ 贴主：出了几十年的队，第一次给警察开saman，第一次听到出队的罗里不能载人。狮友们大家注意你们罗里，不能载人啊！我现在已经中了。 语气中满是无奈与愤怒，还提醒其他「狮友」要特别注意！帖文一出，很快引起关注。不少网民在评论区留言讨论，相关贴文的留言区几乎一面倒，认为无论是否为了舞狮出队，罗里本就不应该载人。有人指出，交通条例早有规定，货车或罗里属于载货用途车辆，若后方车斗并未设有合法座位与安全装置，载人本身就存在安全隐患。 也有网民理性表示，理解舞狮团体出队时为了方便，会选择集体乘坐同一辆 lori 前往表演场地，但若发生意外，后果不堪设想。「平时没事不代表合法」、「一旦紧急刹车或发生碰撞，车斗上的人是最危险的」，类似的留言不断出现。 或许这是长期以来的「行业习惯」。尤其是在一些社区或乡镇地区，舞狮团经费有限，租用巴士或安排多辆私家车接送，成本相对更高。使用 lori 载人，往往是为了节省开销与方便搬运器材，一车同时载狮头、鼓、旗帜及队员，看似效率更高。 不过，从法律与安全角度来看，不少网民仍强调，文化传承固然重要，但不应建立在违规或危险之上。也有人建议，相关单位或协会或许可以加强宣导，让舞狮团体更清楚交通规则，同时探讨是否有更安全的替代方案。 ▼ 双方都中？！ ▼ 看运气？ ▼ 原来如此 ▼ 经济路线 ▼ Opps ▼ 还能十个人？ ▼ erm... ▼ 看门就对了？ 舞狮作为马来西亚多元文化的一部分，一直深受社会重视。每逢佳节，醒狮高桩腾跃的画面，早已成为街头最热闹的风景。然而，这起事件也让不少人开始反思，在传承文化的同时，是否也需要与时并进，兼顾安全与合规。 目前，当事网友并未透露罚款金额，但其贴文已成功提醒不少「狮友」提高警惕。文化需要被珍惜，安全同样不能忽视。对此，你怎么看呢？ 来源：Facebook/Leo Lai

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[大马男子向 XUAN Facebook 专页投稿，控诉前妻婚后多次出车九，还把他当成 ATM，一年多内前后被 pian 了 7 次，令他身心俱疲。 两人于 2021 年通过交友网站认识，交往不久后就约见面，随后她就搬到古晋与他同居，并于 2023 年注册结婚。原以为人生步入稳定阶段的他，未料婚姻会在一年后出现裂痕。 2024 年 12 月，前妻频繁以「回槟城」为由离家，这期间机票由他承担。岂料，她实际并未返回槟城，而是另购机票飞去 KL！他发现不对劲后查询机票记录，并直接飞去机场等她。他接机时发现她身上出现草莓印，而对方却以「故意气他」为由解释，他最终选择相信。 此后情况愈发异常。前妻每月仅短暂回家几天，随后又飞往 KL，再后来甚至飞去中国。有次，他偶然在手机发现验孕棒的购买记录，时间点恰逢两人关系疏远之际，才意识到事情并不单纯！ 男子指出，婚后所有开销都由他承担，包括前妻的车贷、生活费以及多次旅行费用，数年累计超过 RM50,000。他崩溃地表示，自己不是在养老婆，而是在「赞助」她和别人同居。 更令他感到讽刺的是，他们刚认识时，前妻其实和另一名男子结过婚，还没离婚就搬来与他一起住，直到与前夫正式离婚后，才告诉他实情。由于当时正在准备注册结婚，所以选择原谅。 后来，他掌握到前妻与一名中国男子长期同居的证据。前妻的反复欺 pian 不仅导致婚姻破裂，更令他精神受创。他委任律师发出律师函，指控对方在明知女方已婚情况下发展不正当关系，要求停止相关行为、书面回应，并保留民事索赔权利。目前第一封律师函已送达，第二封正在准备中，接下来将正式提起诉讼。 最让他崩溃的是办理离婚手续时期，前妻深夜致电，要求他隔天前往 KL 接她，他毫不犹豫买机票飞过去。对方随后逼他签「和平离婚」，并承诺签字后他们可以重新开始，尽管心里很忐忑，但自己最后还是选择相信她。 然而，文件拿到手那天，她便返回槟城并失去联系。那一刻，他才明白对方从来没想过回头，和他离婚不是为了重新开始，而是为了彻底离开。 如今，前妻已更换电话号码，两人现在仅通过 Email 联系。这一年里，他自认被彻底利用，钱没了，婚姻没了，尊严也差点没了。经过反复利用后，他也逐渐清醒了，决定不再心软，已着手通过法律途径追究责任，为自己讨回一个公道。 我只是想问一句，为什么要这样玩我？ 如果她现在回来，我还会心软吗？ 我自己都不知道。 帖文曝光后，不少网民纷纷留言劝他放过自己，及时止损，别再为一个不值得的人内耗。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a 24F and just signed a lease for a studio in Chicago. This has always been a dream of mine, and I’m really excited — but now that it’s official, I’m trying to make sure I’m thinking about finances realistically.
 I make about $3.8–4k/month take-home. My rent is $1,425 + $90 utilities, and electric is estimated around ~$100. I also have about $900/month in student loans and a dog, so that adds to my monthly expenses.
 I’ve been at my job for a little over 2 years and things seem stable and trending positively. I also have a solid savings. I don’t feel reckless about the move — I just want to make sure I’m setting myself up well and not stretching too thin.
 For anyone who moved to a big city in their 20s with similar numbers, how did you balance being financially responsible while still actually enjoying the city? Any budgeting tips, side hustle ideas, or “first year living on your own” advice would be appreciated.
 Trying to be smart about this while still enjoying the experience.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, now entering its fifth grim year, has already gone on longer than the entire fight on the eastern front in the second world war. The Soviets marched from the gates of Leningrad to Berlin in a little over 15 months in 1944-45; today the Russian rate of gain in Pokrovsk in Ukraine is 70 metres a day, in Kupiansk, 23 metres, according to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.
The gains are trivial, given Ukraine’s size, amounting to 1,865 sq miles during 2025 (about 0.8% of the country) – so the idea touted by the Russians, sometimes accepted by a credulous White House, that Ukraine is suffering a slow-motion defeat, is not accurate.

 looking to get a new roof, guy asked how I'd be paying and I told him I'd probably just pay it off rather than finance (dumb move).
 later in our conversation I ask him, is 0% financing possible cause why not if there's no interest. 
 he says yes, 0 for 12 months but the bank tacks on $3000 in fees so I'll end up paying more at the end. 
 I've never heard of this and have been quoted a price by many contractors and financed it for 0% if paid off in "x" months. 
 is this guy being honest and is this something that happens with bank financing that I've never known about?

The royal commission into antisemitism in Australia will not examine key parts of how the Bondi beach terror attack unfolded because of ongoing criminal proceedings.

One of the country’s leading tax experts says the explosion in housing wealth has put Australia on the path towards a neo-feudal society where your prosperity depends in large part whether your parents own land or property.
The director of the Australian National University’s Tax and Transfer Policy Institute, Bob Breunig, said “that’s the trajectory we’re on”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I’ve been panicking for last couple of weeks and feel like I’m super stuck.
 I’m a nursing student w crazy credit card debt paying for $900 of rent a month. (Which I know is not a lot) but all my income is basically going to my credit card payments and trying to stay a float. I make around $1200 every 2 weeks as a nurse assistant.
 I’ve tried to get a personal loan to pay off the cards but no one will approve me with my 640 score.
 I’ve called CITI to help me out and basically just paused my payment for a month.
 I was able to pay off a whole credit card from chase all in once and lowered my credit score like 20 points??
 HERES MY INFO
 Debt is in 4 cards:
 -CITI-APR is 18.74% & debt $11,496.01
 -C1- APR is 27.74% & $521
 -C2- APR is 18.49% & debt is $3,444
 -B- APR is around 28% & debt is $5,515 EXPENSES $60 phone $100 groceries $80 utilities $80 extra stuff like gas
 I have around 21k in debt in credit card debt, I’m working full time and picking up extra shifts but it’s getting super crazy busy with school, I just feel overwhelmed. What should I do? Any help as to what to do with debt like this while in school? Should I file for bankruptcy??
 Thanks ):

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm looking for advice on what to do. 
 I withdrew around $1900 from my 529 account to pay for educational expenses, and it was sent via check. I had no issues before withdrawing money and receiving checks, but I thought it was odd that 2+ weeks had passed and nothing in the mail. 
 I called 529 today, and they said the check has been cashed out. I have no idea how, because I didn't receive any check. I told them repeatedly I received no check, and the agent on the line was unhelpful. The agent later created a case number and told me to call back later. Called back later, and another agent keeps repeating "It's been paid" several times even though I kept saying I didn't receive it. It probably got lost in the mail, ended up somewhere else, and someone took my check and cashed it out. I kept asking if they have a method to track where the check was sent, and they said, "we're trying." They told me that all the managers are busy, and they'll call back later. I am assuming they're obviously not going to call back. 
 I am in urgent need of this money. It covers multiple expenses. Is there any advice on what to do?? Can't they check which bank account it was deposited into?? Please help :(

 My employer sent me a 1099 NEC recently, which contained my income for the period of time I was 1099. I used that to file with the IRS. Well about a week ago, I received another 1099 NEC corrected in the mail. This new 1099 has every dollar value box listed as zeroes. Does this mean my employer is trying to void the income I made during that period from my taxes? Do I file an amendment stating the new 1099 NEC corrected? Most importantly, if I already paid the IRS taxes on the reported income, can I get a refund?
 TIA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been having this debate with my spouse. We have narrowed down make and model, but split between new vs. dealer certified used.
 New is $45-50k
 Certified pre-owned (CPO) (2-3 years old, 35k-50k miles) is $37-42k
 Dealer tells us interest rate for auto loans is in the 6-8% range, which feels too expensive. I lean towards buying the CPO vehicle, and paying all cash. Then save like a maniac for next 6 months to build back the savings account. 
 Spouse thinks buying new is less hassle.
 What’s the consensus here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My spouse and I are looking into individual disability insurance in addition to our employer coverage.
 Both of our employers provide 60% STD and LTD, but we’d feel more comfortable having an additional 20–25% covered through a portable individual policy.
 Background:
  
Me: 28F, finance
 Spouse: 31M, HR
 Combined household income: ~$155k
 Emergency fund: ~$20k, plus additional liquid cash not tied to other goals
  
I’ve read that 80–90% total income replacement is often considered the “sweet spot” for disability coverage. Is that generally true for people in our income range?
 Specifically:
  
Are individual DI policies covering ~20% of income still worth it?
 Is supplemental DI mainly for very high earners, or does it make sense for middle-income dual-earner households too?
 For context,…]]></summary>

I tracked the past 4 months of my spending and noticed that I am routinely going over $2,000 a month and ~$1,300-$1,500 of it is Restaurants and Grocery. I basically never cook at home. I don't go to shop for groceries, only get them from Instacart and similar apps. Doordash, UberEats and Instacart. Weekly. Sometimes every single day of the week... and I tip, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m 39F. My take-home pay is around RM8.3k, plus RM2k rental income from a property I own.
 Right now I’m staying with my parents. My mortgage + maintenance for my property is about RM3.5k/month. Even after rental, I still top up RM1.5k monthly for a house I don’t live in.
 When I bought the place years ago, I was earning significantly more. I took a 25-year loan because it made sense then. Since then, I’ve had a career change and my income is lower. I don’t regret the change, but financially it’s tighter.
 Here’s what’s weighing on me:
 •I can’t sell the property without taking a loss.
 •If I move into it after the tenant’s lease ends, I’ll be paying RM3.5k out of RM8.3k (~42% of my income) just for mortgage + maintenance. That doesn’t include utilities, furnishing, minor renovations, or general living costs.
 Technically, I can afford it. But it would feel tight. I wouldn’t have much buffer for saving or investing, and that makes me uneasy.
 At the same time, I’m 39 and still living with my parents. They’re not forcing me out, and we’re on good terms. But emotionally, I feel… stalled. I want my own space. I want autonomy. I want to feel like I’m building my life, not just optimizing spreadsheets.
 To make moving out workable, I’m considering refinancing from 25 years to 30 years to lower the monthly instalment.
 Financially, I know it means paying more interest long term. Emotionally, it might buy me independence and breathing room.
 I guess my real question is: Is it foolish to stretch a loan tenure for lifestyle reasons? Or is this one of those times where optimizing for quality of life is valid?
 Would really appreciate perspectives, especially from anyone who’s navigated property decisions after a career/income shift.

FedEx sued the US government on Monday, seeking a refund for the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump that were deemed illegal by the US supreme court last week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a toddler at home, and sometimes it feels like every peso I earn goes straight to diapers, food, and school needs. By the end of the month, I’m left wondering if I actually saved anything at all.
 I try to plan ahead, but unexpected expenses always come up — a sick child, home repairs, or even just a small “fun” treat for my little one. It makes me realize that being a parent isn’t just about earning money; it’s about constantly balancing priorities while thinking long-term.
 Does anyone else feel like no matter how careful you budget, something unexpected happens and wipes out your savings? How do you plan around those little surprises?
 Building an emergency fund at this stage feels so hard. I honestly feel overwhelmed.

Shortly after Donald Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the Binance founder, last fall, company employees revealed the cryptocurrency exchange may have funded Iranian entities with billions of dollars, according to a report by the New York Times.
The discovery was made by a group of internal Binance investigators, who reportedly found that people in Iran had accessed more than 1,500 accounts on the crypto platform. Two of those accounts allegedly saw $1.7bn move to Iranian-backed groups that included Yemen’s Houthi militants throughout 2024 and 2025, according to the Wall Street Journal.

 (94k annually, overtime if project calls for it)
 I've been working full-time for around 4-5 months. I'm gearing to move my money around more seriously now I've settled, I'm thinking about cutting my 401k contribution to 5%(min to match). Or just keeping the budget as is and throwing any leftover to it.
 I'm firm on keeping my HYSA for emergency funds.
 Loans
  
Car Loan -17.0k @ 7.9%: Payment Started OCT2024
 Student Loan - 20.5k @ 7.8%: Payment Started FEB2026
 Medical Loan - 1.5k @ 0.0%: Payment Started DEC2025
  
Is there any other place I could cut in my budget? I'm living with parents for a while helping a bit with their bills. VHCOL. Thanks!

 Shock stage over(ish) and I’m starting to look into what’s next. 
 Background - we just had our first child after years of struggles. My wife does not work at the time being. We’re both 40. 
 Main questions for this community are: 
 The job market is rough right now, how secure are we for the time being? 
 Should we consider moving money around/or and selling assets?
 Monies in our investment fund - should we keep it there? 
 A bit worrisome time tied along with the state of the economy. I would appreciate any advice. TY

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My spouse and I co-own a house in a high-tax area (NY) with a sibling. It was my spouse’s childhood home, so there is significant emotional attachment.
 The house is currently rented and roughly covers the existing mortgage. Estimated value is $450k and still owe 85k on mortgage.
 However: • It needs approximately $50k in major, non-cosmetic repairs in the near term (roof, septic, furnace, oil tank). • The home has not had cosmetic updates in ~30 years. • It’s in a high property tax area.
 The sibling would like to be bought out. If we do that, we would need to refinance and take on a new loan. At current rates, the property would likely not fully cash flow. Rent would be close but would not cover principal + interest + taxes + insurance, especially once factoring in upcoming repairs.
 Additional context: • Our personal finances are not in strong shape. • We are carrying debt. • Our credit is not strong. • We are not being approved for favorable traditional loan terms. • We do not have sufficient reserves to comfortably absorb $50k in repairs. • We have young kids and other financial obligations.
 From a purely financial standpoint, selling and splitting proceeds would likely strengthen our situation and reduce risk.
 However, emotionally this is my spouse’s childhood home, and selling it feels like closing a chapter for him.
 My question isn’t just “does this cash flow?” I know the numbers are tight. It’s: how do couples responsibly weigh deep sentimental attachment against financial fragility?
 Is it ever reasonable to carry a property that doesn’t cash flow and needs major capital work if finances are already stretched? Or is that simply too much risk regardless of emotional value?
 Looking for perspective from people who’ve navigated similar decisions.

Donald Trump’s decision to order airstrikes against Iran will hinge in part on the judgment of Trump’s special envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, about whether Tehran is stalling over a deal to relinquish its capacity to produce nuclear weapons, according to people familiar with the matter.
The president has not made a final determination on any strikes, as the administration prepares for Iran to send its latest proposal this week, ahead of what officials have described as a last-ditch round of negotiations scheduled for Thursday in Geneva.

There is a moment in Channel 4’s drama Dirty Business when Julie Maughan holds the body of her dead child and lets out an anguished cry. It is as brutal as it is compelling.
Her eight-year-old daughter Heather had just died in hospital, two weeks after playing in the sea on the beach at Dawlish Warren in Devon, where she contracted E coli O157, a bug which comes from raw sewage. She became ill with diarrhoea and blood loss. Transferred to Bristol children’s hospital, her parents agreed to switch off her life-support machine after she suffered kidney failure and brain damage.

Due to this increase, my retirement contributions will exceed $70,000 for 2025. While this is a good problem to have, it is a problem I need to rectify. Details below: 
 Contributions: 401(k) $23,500 401(k) Match $9,823.18 ESOP est. $48,320.00 
 I have details from colleagues where this is handled automatically in May/June for the previous year when the contribution is finalized. However, I am also under the impression this excess contribution would be double taxed if not handled by April 15. Should I call my retirement plan manager now to withdraw an estimated amount? And then any minimal remaining excess would be subject to the double tax?

Violence in Mexico after military kills notorious drug cartel boss – a visual guide

With schools still closed, flights cancelled and the charred carcasses of buses smouldering on streets across the country, Mexico was still reeling from the cartel backlash prompted by the killing of cartel kingpin Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, also known as “El Mencho”.
Defense minister, Ricardo Trevilla Trejo, was moved almost to tears on Monday as he offered his condolences to the families of soldiers felled in the operation to kill the country’s most-wanted drug lord. Mexican military personnel, he said, “fulfilled their mission”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm 18 years old, and within the next few months I'm coming into around $160k that my mom put aside for me from around half of my father's life insurance payout. I've known about this for around 5 years, so it isn't unexpected. Despite this, the anxiety surrounding the lump sum is still overwhelming. I have read through this subreddit's wiki and some other advice, but I want more targeted information, and to be completely honest a lot of the information is flying over my head as I'm not financially literate/savvy.
 Here are some things I plan to do in the future: - 2 years of community college (free) --> transfer 2 years state school - Open a Roth IRA and put maximum contributions into it - Put a sum of money into a HYSA - Making diversified investments with a portion of the money (ie. ETFs, bonds, mutual funds) - Likely to be living with my mom for the next 4 years to maximize savings & help with mortgage - Discuss my situation to a non-commissioned financial advisor - Don't touch any of the lump sum unless absolutely necessary
 My mom is also urging me to not use a credit card as I can likely pay most things off with cash, but I don't know if that's the best option. I'll likely only open one credit card and make monthly subscription payments with it, paying it off immediately. I think it's a good fallback in case anything goes wrong, but I'm not an expert in credit and only have knowledge that's scraping the surface.
 Essentially, I would like to know if there are any glaring problems I should be considering in my future financial plan. I don't mind any longer reading materials if it's an investment for my future and well-being.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there - this is about my mother, so any advice would be helpful.
 Background: My mother (F64), was mostly a stay at home mom for the majority of her working career - as she had 6 kids. My dad then walked out on all of us, leaving my mom to go back to school to get her degree and teaching credentials so she could teach Special Education. So she finally has been working in special education at a Charter school (not public) for the last 5 years. (Note - my mother found out years later they weren’t legally married - she found out at city hall when she went to file divorce papers)
 Finances: Because she was a stay at home mom for so long, we are assuming her SS is going to be fairly small. Additionally, she only started a 401k a few years back but only about $5k in it. Thankfully she has no debt.
 Question: How should I help her to plan for any kind of retirement? At this point is maxing out her 401k her best option? Her employer doesn’t match - so should we skip 401k and put it into straight into an IRA? What will give her the most flexibility and biggest return since we don’t really want to wait 30 years for it to grow.
 Note: One of us kids are planning to take her in when she gets older, but she’s young enough now that she loves her freedom and even her mother at 88 currently lives by herself because she likes the freedom.

A least 606 people trying to reach Europe in search of refugee have been reported dead or missing in the Mediterranean since the beginning of 2026, marking the “deadliest start to a year” in more than a decade, the UN’s migration agency said on Monday.
The figure includes at least 30 people who are feared dead or missing after their boat capsized in severe weather off the coast of Greece on Saturday. Authorities rescued 20 people, including four minors, and recovered the bodies of three men and one woman, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), said.

 They haven't refunded me for 3 months. I filed with Amex for a chargeback, its been 2 months since then, I gave them all proofs of what I am owed. Amex rules in my favor, and they said I will get a chargeback issued on my next statement. The next statement date is tomorrow. But I received an email from the bank that they want to issue me a refund and they need my bank account details.
 Should I be giving them my bank account details? I am not sure if that would affect my chargeback tomorrow. Or if I would just get twice the money lol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I am in need of a new vehicle and need help deciding what to do. I have a 2011 Hyundai that has slowly become a money pit. I bought the car in 2021 and after thousands in repairs, new problems continue to come up and I've decided I am done with it. I am 27 and I have only ever bought older used cars in cash.
 I started looking for another vehicle and have test driven a bunch of cars and I have not been happy with any of them. I planned on using ~15k cash to get a used car, nothing special but I am hoping for something with known reliability (Honda or Toyota). But so far every car I've looked at in this range is just not worth the money, high miles, lots of cosmetic damage, or obvious mechanical issues. I even stretched to look at cars closer to 20k and seeing many cars in that price range with over 100k miles and the condition some were in was ridiculous to me. 
 So I learned that it appears the used car market has had quite the shift and used car prices have exploded. So for the first time ever I am considering buying a new car instead of saving $5-10k to buy a used car that I'll have to replace much sooner. I am looking at the 2026 base model Civic which is around $26k. I currently make $67k (~$4500 net/mo) with no debt other than a cheap mortgage and my monthly expenses including "extra/fun" money comes out to about $2000. On a rough estimate, I believe close to 15k down and hopefully a bit of trade in value, it looks like I might be looking at a $250-300 payment for 60 months. 
 Considering I hope to keep the car for 10+ years, is this a good idea? Or a completely horrible idea and I should keep looking for a used car?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m 29 and live with parents so I save on rent. Although my choice is not driven by savings but because of cultural customs to stay home until marriage. Family has stopped me from leaving before.
 Some financial info; I make $85k working mostly remote (very seldom do I have to travel or commute), have $35k in Roth IRA, $7k in 401k, $1k in HSA, $45k across savings, checking, and brokerage accounts, $21k student debt, and annual expenses are approx $5k (internet, auto insurance, student loans, trash). This is my split of bills I pay for the household internet, trash, an all auto vehicle insurance. I do not pay for food or rent. This wasnt set up, it just everyone happened to pick certain bills they can help with.
 My relationship with family is very strained. I won’t go into detail but I will just say that I am completely isolated at home. I work remotely so I need quiet space and have had this issue with my family previously but they moved me into a room that used to be a garage and is close to the laundry and food pantry. There is a lot of activity during the day (we are all 7 living in the same house) and they would turn the washer and dryer during my work hours even though this was communicated before. Long story short, even before this, my relationship with them was never close and it comes from years of conflict. 
 But they won’t let me move out. This is more culturally than financially because I’m a woman and blah blah women should stay home until marriage. 
 I need to make a decision and need help with determining if I should buy a home with my sister or rent. I feel like renting is such a waste but also understand that buying coming with a lot of expenses im not ready for. 
 Would the best option for me be to rent a small studio maximum $1700 rent, or buy a small condo at a max of $300k?

More than 45 days after a brutal January crackdown that left thousands of Iranian protesters dead, students across several universities are protesting again. As Iran’s new academic term began on Saturday, students in Tehran gathered on campus, chanting anti-government slogans, despite a heavy security presence and plainclothes officers stationed outside university gates.
The Guardian spoke to protesting students about why they were rallying despite the fact that thousands had been killed and tens of thousands arrested in the January demonstrations.

 I’m a 33 yo male working as a senior data analyst earning 12k myr per month net. I have an mba from a foreign university where i got a 3.71 gpa but decided to return to Malaysia after i graduated. 
 My previous role prior to data analytics was in business development in the same company I’m at today but I feel like the contents of my job are lacking so I’ve been thinking about entering into management consulting. Given that I’m an experienced professional already, what do you think are the chances of getting into a decent firm and do you have any experience to share regarding the consulting industry?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m budgeting for a 2-bedroom move from the Philly area down to Florida. I spent all week getting quotes, but the business models and contracts are completely different. I need someone financially savvy to tell me which one is actually the safest bet, because I am terrified of hidden fees.
 **Quote 1 (Ryder Relocations - The Broker): $2,400**
 * _The catch:_ It’s a 'Non-Binding' volume estimate. My research on Reddit shows they act as a broker and sell the job to a third-party driver. I've read absolute horror stories on here about them doubling the price on moving day, but $2,400 is so cheap it's tempting.
 **Quote 2 (Fairprice Movers - Local PA Carrier): $4,600**
 * _The catch:_ It’s more expensive upfront, but it is a **Guaranteed Binding Quote**. They put it in writing that they do a strict numbered inventory, do not use transfer warehouses, and use their own dedicated crew for the entire PA to FL drive. The price legally cannot change.
 **Quote 3 (United Van Lines - Major Corporate): $6,800**
 * _The catch:_ It’s based on weight. If my stuff weighs more at the highway weigh station, the price goes up. Also, because they consolidate shipments, they gave me a 2-to-21-day delivery window. I work from home and can't wait 3 weeks for my desk, but they are big!
 From a purely financial/risk standpoint, is it mathematically smarter to lock in the $4,600 binding quote with Fairprice so my budget is protected, or should I roll the dice with the cheap Ryder quote and hope for the best?

Residents of one of India’s most upmarket neighbourhoods say the country’s first “musical road” has turned their daily lives into a nightmare soundtrack.
A stretch of Mumbai’s recently opened Coastal Road seafront expressway has been engineered to play the pulsating Oscar-winning tune Jai Ho from the movie Slumdog Millionaire when vehicles drive on it at lower speeds.

New South Wales authorities are preparing for about a third of the group of Australian women and children linked to Islamic State fighters to return to the state, if authorities in Syria allow them to leave the Roj refugee camp.
The premier, Chris Minns, said the state government had been discussing the possible return of some of the 11 women and 23 children with federal government agencies since late 2025, and a strong law enforcement response was expected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I made a post the other day regarding my inheritance and my plan to put it all into EPF. It is just over 1 million ringgit and some of you told me it's better to put a large % of it into ETFs instead.
 I wasn't really familiar with ETFs so I read through this sub abit and found VWRA was a good one and I have somewhat of an understanding of what it is. However, I see alot of you DCA into it which I think means putting abit abit each month since it's safer incase you invested during a bad time.
 Should I still do this? I'm thinking yes, but what's a good amount and time interval? I've downloaded Fsmone (still waiting for my account to be approved, it's been a week :() and is it safe to put in this much money? 
 I don't plan to use this money at all and I can sustain myself with my job so ideally I'd want to put 80+% of the million.
 Thanks in advance

Anthony Albanese says former opposition leader, Sussan Ley was “undermined” by conservative colleagues, Angus Taylor and Andrew Hastie, during her 276-day tenure in the seat.
Speaking to Hit 104.9, which covers Ley’s southern NSW electorate of Farrer, the prime minister criticised the Coalition’s recent internal turmoil while praising his own side of politics. Albanese said:
From day one, she was undermined by Angus Taylor and Andrew Hastie and a range of them who weren’t really working to try to get her success in the party. …
It’s, I think, unfortunate that politics can be a pretty rough game, and that [Ley] was elected by the Liberal party caucus, fair and square, she was the leader, but never even got to give a budget reply. I don’t know if that’s happened before. I’m not sure, but certainly she didn’t even get one year in the office, which is pretty rough.
We want to ensure that people who leave our country and go to terrorist hotspots, people who go there to support terrorist organisations or to support Islamic State or organisations or other terror listed organisations, and then who actually commit crimes over there … they can’t come back to Australia.
I’ve got a newsflash for the government. They are the government. They can change the law. If the law is not strong enough to keep Australians safe and to keep people out who actually hate Australian values and hate the Australian way of life, and who have left our country to fight for an alternate way of life, then we should change those laws.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys. I have a background in maths and finance, and I've been working on a set of trading strategies for FX and stocks, currently looking to paper trade before deploying fully through an algorithm. Whats a good platform to use? For stocks I currently have moomoo, but idk how it would work with my automation. Also how would capital gains tax work if im regularly buying and selling a stock?
 As far as FX goes, is there a good platform that is safe? I'm finding it hard to get good advice on it because most people i know who trade Forex are those Forex bros using dodgy unregulated platforms like Justmarket that offer up to 3000x leverage which i think is kinda predatory. I have worked in asset management before and done some investing but pretty clueless as far as actual active day trading goes. Whats a good pip spread for currency pairs like USD/EUR? which platforms offer them, and as far as leverage goes whats a healthy and safe range I could play with or do you think it would be better to stay clear of that?
 Let me know what you think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[拍拖本来是甜甜的事情，但有时候，现实问题一来，心真的会很累。 近日，大马一名女子在「XUAN」发文表示，自己在两性关系中遇到了很大的困扰，不知道该不该继续坚持下去。 她说，男友不支持 AA 制，认为情侣之间不必算得太清楚。但她坚持 AA，是因为不想以后谈婚论嫁时，为钱财问题产生更多矛盾。她说，如果用「这次你请，下次我请」的方式，她常常会忘记上一次是谁付钱，心里反而更有压力。 更让她难受的是，只要男友请客，她就会觉得亏欠对方。她有时晚餐只想简单吃个面包，但男友却坚持要她点饭，还说吃不完他可以帮忙吃。如果她想喝 100Plus，男友也会阻止，说不如去商场买，更便宜，叫她改喝别的水。她觉得，连吃什么、喝什么，都要被管。 除了金钱观不同，男友的性格也让她很为难。男友常常和家人发生争执，就算她在场，对方也会直接开骂，完全不顾她的感受。她尝试过劝说，有话可以好好讲，不一定要用骂的方式，但男友始终觉得自己没有错，也听不进她的意见。 她也提到，男友很喜欢为自己的错误找借口。她生日那天，自己订了一家喜欢的餐厅，晚上 8 点用餐。因为两人住在不同地方，她提议各自前往餐厅，但男友坚持要先到她家载她。她提醒男友要早点出门，至少预留一小时，因为晚餐时间会塞车。没想到，男友还是在 7 点 30 分才出门，结果迟到，餐厅位置也没了。 她非常生气。男友虽然道歉，却解释说「没想到会塞车」。她无奈地说，自己已经提醒过，为什么还是拖到最后才出门？男友却表示，平时没有遇到塞车。最后，她还是选择原谅。 她坦言，每次吵架，男友都会主动说对不起，但她感觉对方并没有真正理解问题。无论她如何耐心解释，对方始终觉得自己是对的。 在报备行踪方面，两人也有分歧。男友认为没有必要报备，因为她也没有要求自己报备。但她表示，男友每天都会和异性聊天，甚至聊完后删除聊天记录，这让她没有安全感。她只是希望对方简单报备一下，却被男友反驳：「当初就是因为你不需要我报备，我才选择和你在一起。」 女子无奈表示，这段感情让她越来越累。她不知道，是自己太计较，还是两人真的不合适。她把经历分享出来，只希望听听大家的意见，也想弄清楚，这样的关系是否值得继续。 ▼ 继续在一起会很痛苦的，分吧！ 感情不是谁对谁错，而是能不能互相体谅。如果一直委屈自己，这段感情还能走多远呢？

 I’m 20, starting college in five months(paying for it by working during school), and have $30k in savings, $17k in gold/silver, and $1.6k in my Roth IRA. I haven’t contributed to my 2025 Roth yet (deadline April 15, 2026) and already put $1.6k toward 2026. My goal is early financial freedom, but I prefer staying cash-heavy and wanted $35k saved before college. I’m deciding whether to use some savings to max my 2025 Roth contribution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Around a year ago, I was sick for a prolonged period, so I decided to go to my university's health center. The university advertises that students who take x or more credits (which I qualfiied for) "do not pay copays or coinsurance for provider visits at [name]! " . I also asked the front-desk if/how much would be billed to insurance, and they said that it should be covered for students. It turned out to be the flu, and the only thing that the medical staff member did was give me a flu and covid test. The next day, I am completely fine and recover on my own after the week-ish of abnormal shivers and sickness. I would have never went to the student care if they provided price transparency instead of deceiving students.
 I then get a bill for ~$400, and although insurance adjusted it by a bit, it's still $300. It's not covered by insurance because my insurance has a high deductible.
 I have heard that you can negotiate even if you have insurance, so long as you are willing to pay immediately. If they bring the bill down to a REASONABLE amount ($100-150), I would be able to pay immediately.
 Can someone please provide me with some tips to negotiate this urgent care visit given the circumstances of me being a student (I still am a student) and it being health services provided by the university?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Malaysia’s Islamist party is taking control of the opposition coalition following months of internal rift, which could increase its influence and disrupt the political landscape ahead of a general election.
 The Perikatan Nasional alliance named Ahmad Samsuri Mokhtar from the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party as its chairman, a move that will embolden PAS and allow it to assert its dominance.
 PAS's leadership of the opposition coalition may lead to a period of competitive conservatism, with a clash of Islamic narratives between PAS's more dogmatic approach and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's moderate Islam.

 I am a CPA and am working in a company that has been bought out by a pe firm. I am not sure if they will layoff but we were told if that happens there will be severance. It’s a wonderful company but I figured that starting q2 I will start looking for another job as I see people who have been here over 10 years resigning.
 I have about 60k in an emergency und and this would cover about 1 year of expenses for me. I have 72k ina 401k. I know I am behind on retirement savings so I am now saving the max for 401k and I save about 2 k every month. My salary is 170k and there is a 55k bonus that would be paid out next march. Is this an ok savings rate? My mortgage is under 80k, at 3.75%.
 Also is 60k a decent emergency fund? This would cover 1 year of expenses for me. Do you think I should just pay off the mortgage? My monthly mortgage payment is 2000, of which 500 is property tax.

I need some additional funds for closing costs, repairs, and furniture. Interest rates are 6% right now. Should I take out a mortgage or get a 50k loan from my 401k? I could also not do renovations right away (new master bath and kitchen) and save up for them later but there could be some things that need to be repaired in the beginning (electrical, appliances). I have a good amount already saved for retirement. My salary is 109k a year with stable long term employment. I am married and my husband has a lot saved up but refuses to contribute (but he covers expenses for our primary house).

 I get access to a 401k with max $12,500 employer contribution, ESPP that I can contribute 1-15% of my paycheck to, and a HSA. What is worth prioritizing my money towards first? I was trying to max out my 401k, then $200 per paycheck to HSA then I'm lost about ESPP. How much should I be trying to put towards ESPP? I'm still trying to get a budget figured out. Thanks in advance!

Violence erupts after Mexican security forces kill drug cartel boss ‘El Mencho’ 

The drug lord “El Mencho”, who was killed on Sunday by Mexican special forces, was the co-founder and leader of a gang that in recent years had become the country’s most powerful criminal organisation: the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG).
While less internationally famous than the Sinaloa cartel of the now imprisoned Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, the CJNG is a household name in Mexico, where it is known for its displays of ultraviolence and its big, military-style arsenal.

She is now 9 months old. Unfortunately, I have to rehome her, and I'm desperately seeking helpful advice on how to make this process easier for both her and myself.
 I've been planning to immigrate to Australia from Malaysia for a few months now. While I'm excited about this new chapter in my life, I am also heartbroken that I need to rehome my cat. I can't take her with me due to the strict pet relocation rules in Australia, and Malaysia is not an approved country for relocating pets. Even if it was, I wouldn't have the financial means to cover the expenses.
 Has anyone here gone through a similar situation? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

The one card has $6,659.92 and APR is 26.49%, another card with $7,068.72 has an APR of 21.49%, the last card has $741.66 with $35.99% APR. I make payments to all of these monthly, but I just can't seem to make a dent with the interest piling on top. My car is going to need replaced soon, so I'm panicking about having all of these lines of credit open and not being able to have a decent downpayment on a new (to me, but still used) car. I can't afford $500/month in a car payment, so I'm trying to figure out if consolidating my debt is worth it at all or what I should do here. I never learned financial literacy and I'm trying to teach myself and I'm struggling HARD. :(

Residents along the east coast scrambled to prepare for the late-winter storm that spurred weather warnings from Maryland to Massachusetts, affecting more than 35 million people. More than a foot of snow was expected, with wind gusts of up to 70mph and warnings of potential coastal flooding from Cape Cod to Delaware.

The New South Wales environment watchdog has ordered Sydney Water to remove fats from its Malabar wastewater treatment plant, a month after Guardian Australia revealed a huge fatberg was responsible for the poo balls that closed beaches last summer.
Sydney Water isn’t sure exactly how big the fatberg is because it cannot easily access the area where it has accumulated. It could be the size of four Sydney buses.

Who was El Mencho, the former police officer who co-founded an ultraviolent cartel in Mexico?

One of the world’s most wanted drug traffickers, the Mexican cartel boss known as “El Mencho”, has been killed by security forces, Mexico’s defence ministry has confirmed. The operation set off a wave of violence, with torched cars and gunmen blocking highways in more than half a dozen states.
The drug lord, whose real name is Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, was killed on Sunday in the western state of Jalisco along with at least six alleged accomplices, the ministry said in a statement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, this is weird and hopefully makes sense.
 I was alerted today by both Chase and Experian that a dormant credit card account with Chase was suddenly active. Looking into Experian, the charged amount was $3300. Of note, I recently signed up for Experian alerts after freezing my credit. The account says it was opened in 2010 on Experian. I have no record of this account and when I talked with a Chase representative, they say my only credit card with them has a zero balance. I typed in the last 4 of the account in question and Chase says it’s not an account with them. It says I am an authorized user on Experian, my parents don’t have any Chase cards and I’ve never been on any of their cards as a User. Same with other relatives
 So far so I have: - sent a secure message to Chase with pictures from Experian of this account in question - filed a dispute with all 3 credit bureaus
 What the heck is going on? It doesn’t even seem like this account exists with Chase! Chase was super unhelpful and confused as well and I’ve been unable to talk to Experian. FYI I didn’t freeze my credit for any particular reason other than my mom telling me she froze her credit.

Police searches of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s former home on the Windsor estate in Berkshire continued on Sunday as a government minister did not rule out having a judge-led inquiry into the former prince’s links with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, representing the government, did not rule out such an inquiry but said it was premature because of the police investigation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I opened up a 360 Checking account with Capital One a few weeks ago with the intent of using it a secondary account to send wire transfers from since you are able to do it online instead of in-person like my other bank requires (the closest branch is very far away since I moved. However, whenever I go to the "wire transfer" section via the Capital One dashboard I get an error stating "this account is too new". I called support and they just said "they think its like 30-60 days, maybe" but couldn't give me a definitive answer. 
 So tl;dr: does anyone know how long until my Capital One 360 Checking account needs to be open for before I can send a wire transfer? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m about to work two jobs. My “main“ job is a part time job at a grocery store, which has been cutting my hours and the store director gets in a mood whenever we stay over so more often than not it’s not an option. They never promote any full time workers, so getting full time is extremely unlikely. I told myself I either need to find a better job or a second job.
 So far the only other place to have contacted me back and hire me is another grocery store. I’ll be working morning and mid shifts at the first one, closing at the second.
 Issue is, the hours of my first job fluctuate— I can be working less then 20 hours for months, but then suddenly be working over 30 hours, six days a week, the next couple weeks. Which means I can be working 50+ hours some weeks with two jobs. I also have my benefits and paid vacations at the first job that I’m reluctant to lose right away and start over at another job.
 However, I need the finances. I’m in student loan debt, have to pay for my own groceries, am trying to move out of a toxic household, and would need to eventually pay for other expenses later on. Working at my inconsistent first job alone isn’t enough anymore if I’m going to survive off only $200 each week on my low weeks.
 I am worried about burn out, though, and the lack of a social life and time to myself. Since my off days are inconsistent at both jobs, I can’t guarantee any days off unless I request off (and since I’m opening at the one, closing at the other, my whole day will be booked). I am going to see how it goes and if I can’t handle it, I’ll quit one of the jobs. I’ll also continue looking for better jobs and side hustles in the meantime. 
 But I just wanted to ask if it’s worth doing two jobs in my circumstances? I know the answer seems obvious. But I’m just worried about burn out. At the very least, any tips on how to endure and not feel so burn out?

Ministers will unveil a “generational” overhaul of special educational needs and disabilities (Send) support, pledging £4bn to transform provision in schools in England and warning councils they could lose control of Send services if they fail to meet their legal duties.
The reforms are expected to be a key policy moment for Keir Starmer and for the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson – who delayed the changes last autumn after a ferocious backlash from MPs and parents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a 2015 Silverado with 139,380 miles. I owe about 11k on the truck. The transmission is slipping and the transmission fluid is dark in color (lighter brown/black) and can smell it burning. it made a trip hauling a 12 foot U-Haul trailer 1,300 miles like this with no problem. So I figured if the tranny was going to go out it would have then. My transmission cooler lines are also leaking, and I have an oil leak. or I can pay 4k and someone offered to buy it for 7k and just get out of the loan by paying the 4k and get something else in a few months. The cost to repair everything will probably be around 8,000$ which I really don’t have right now.
 Do I sell it and spend 4 k to get out of the loan and eventually get a new vehicle, or spend the 8 k to fix it while I owe 111k and it has 140k miles?

Iran and the US are expected to meet for a further round of talks in Geneva this week in a sign that Donald Trump’s team believes Tehran is making serious proposals to dilute its stockpile of highly enriched uranium and show it is not seeking a nuclear weapon.
As fears loomed of renewed conflict after Washington carried out a major redeployment of military assets to the region, the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said he thought there was still a good chance of finding a diplomatic solution.

I put 2k aside every month into ASB. EPF is approximately 2k a month (employee + employer). I'm thinking of either putting RM500 aside for ETFs or taking a small chunk of my monthly ASB savings and putting into ETF. It should look something like this: RM1.5k ASB & RM1k ETF
 Is that a smart move? Please help a bro out as I'm financially illiterate. What other investment options are there?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this is probably common knowledge for folks... but I always figured there was a limit to how high insurance companies will jack your rates over time. I was wrong, and hopefully this will help some others.
 I've been noticing my escrow payments slowly climbing over the years. there have been some large fires in my area that destroyed a lot of homes as well as tax increases, so I chalked it up to that for a long time. Payments had gotten to ridiculous levels lately (north of $1k per month through Liberty Mutual), so I finally decided to shop around.
 I ended up reducing my premium by 75% for significantly better coverage by switching to another company... Not naming names since I don't want this to seem like an ad. just a warning. When I called to cancel, the retention agent had the gall to insinuate it was my fault for not calling earlier to complain. apparently, loyalty for nearly a decade and no claims filed isn't enough to get a low rate. 
 tl;dr - if you haven't checked your insurance rates lately, do it. They might be boiling you like the proverbial frog. I don't know if all companies do this, but screw Liberty Mutual. Oh, and your commercials are annoying.

Top US trade negotiator Jamieson Greer insisted on Sunday that the Trump administration was set to persist with its tariffs policy, two days after the supreme court declared many of Donald Trump’s tariffs illegal.
The ruling issued on Friday by the highest US court was a sharp rebuke to the Republican president that toppled a key pillar of his aggressive economic agenda – even as it prompted Trump to announce a new global tariff using different statutes, albeit temporary.

 ———————————————————————
 I am reeling with disastrous revelations and need some advice on my finances.
 My husband and I are in our 30s and have decently paying jobs.
 3 months ago I found out that my husband has a gambling addiction, and has drained our entire savings towards gambling. He has also opened 5 new credit cards in my name (without me knowing) and has run up a net total of USD 75,000 on them.

I could get a house now for $500-$600k but those are all in areas I don’t really want to live. I currently have $300k ready for a down payment but thinking I may need $400k saved to make the loan more suitable. My retirement is currently around $700k, I make $160k annual with a $50k bonus. No debt. It may be more of a wants versus needs conversation but I’m curious if others think this is too much to spend on a house with my numbers?

Searches are expected to continue today at Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s previous home – Royal Lodge, in Windsor – as calls grow for a probe into the former prince’s links with Jeffrey Epstein.
Lucy Hough speaks to the Guardian’s police and crime correspondent, Vikram Dodd, about what could be next for Andrew here:
If the government bring forward this bill with the support of the King then we will back it. We have to be realistic. Andrew is the eighth in line to the throne, so there’s no chance of him becoming our monarch.
And so parliament really should be focused on things that are of more importance to the public, whether that’s the economy, crime, the health service, immigration. But if the bill does come before parliament, then we’ll support it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im in the planning/estimating phase of a new home build. 
 So here's the situation. I already own the land and there is a house on the lot. We live in it but it needs everything. Roof, mold mitigation, every wall is plaster, subfloor are warped, electric and plumbing are shot, hvac is not installed right, every window and door is clapped, foundation is crumbling, Ghosts ect.
 I could throw 200k at it and we would still have problems. Zillow estimate puts us at 350k but houses around here sell for like 600k+ and we're in a primo spot so tbd on what we will appraise at.
 The house sits on a 5 acer plot and I want to build a new house next to it and demo the old one. 
 I have a background in engineering and I manage contractors for a living so I want to be my own GC. The house will be a barndo. I have quotes for the kit, construction, site work and ill bid out the other trades when we're ready for rough in work once all the framing is done.
 Question is should I take out a construction loan? I was looking into FFBKC since they let you be your own GC and lend for the barndo concept 
 Or should I take out a HELOC and borrow what's needed. Or cash out refinance and use the money from that.
 I have about 100k cash for this venture and no debt. I make 145k annually.

Mom is a stay at home housewife so she usually cooks me lunch for me to bawak bekal to office. Same goes for dinner, as she cooks for the whole family.
 I am also naturally frugal and dont spend much on clothes or outing. No financial commitment as well. No girlfriend, car, or any student loan. I also commute to work by public transport everyday. So technically I only spend about RM200 out of my pocket every month for Netflix, PS+, late night kopitiam etc. This means I save RM4k/month on the regular after deducting all my expenses.

The mother of a student who was killed in the 2023 Nottingham attacks has said she will “fight to the bitter end” to get to the truth of how Valdo Calocane was free to attack, before the beginning of a public inquiry into the incident.
Barnaby Webber and Grace O’Malley-Kumar, 19-year-old students, and 65-year-old caretaker Ian Coates were fatally stabbed by Calocane on 13 June 2023 in a frenzied attack. Early the next day, Calocane drove a van into pedestrians Wayne Birkett, Sharon Miller and Marcin Gawronski, leaving all three with severe and life-changing injuries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I got into a dispute with ATT because they of a trade in. I turned in my phone to upgrade to an s25 and they said it would cover the bill of the s25. After six months I was still being billed the full price. After several calls they said they never got it. I called the store and they said they don’t have records dating back six months. I recorded all these conversations. I got in touch with someone from their “office of the president” who played phone tag with me for a week and then claimed the matter was resolved in an email. 
 I got sick of it and went to Verizon. ATT sent me a bill for 800. They charged my credit card which I disputed because I did nott consent to that charge. I logged in to my att portal and it shows I have a negative balance of $765. 
 What is the best course of action here?

The US Secret Service shot and killed an armed intruder who breached the perimeter of Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump’s Florida residence and private club in Palm Beach, early on Sunday.
Although the US president often spends weekends at the ocean resort, he was at the White House in Washington during this incident, as was first lady Melania Trump.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I currently hold over $10k in a HYSA. My living expenses are roughly $1k-1.5k a month (renting from friend's parent) and I make on average $3.2k a month (Contract work). Got nailed by taxes pretty hard ($6k), and I'm looking at how to plan moving forward outside of memorizing the tax code for my state lol.
 My original plan was to set up a sinking fund to cover moving out expenses (10%) and put 15% into the Rath. However that plan needs to be put on pause for obvious reasons. Now I could dip into my efund and simply adjust said plan, with the 15% going into rebuilding it and the 10% going into the IRA, but while these taxes are definitely scary, I think I can pay them off with monthly payments and by filing an extension. I had no issues paying them off last year, so I don't have a negative reputation with the IRS. That and the last thing I need is to pay off taxes only for an actual emergency to happen.
 What do yall think? Is this a sound approach to dealing with these expenses? Would you deem taxes a suitable emergency? Should I drop everything (including the Rath) to pay these off (Baby Step 2)? Would love your feedback.
 If I don't respond immediately, I'm on the way home. Thanks everyone!

Graeme Wearden: Trump’s trade war risks undermining his hopes of hefty US interest rate cuts

High-level talks with the US administration over the threat of increased tariffs are under way as the UK government says it wants “the best possible deal” for UK companies.
Business leaders said they expected the UK to “double down” on the existing Economic Prosperity Deal (EPD) – announced by Donald Trump and Keir Starmer in May last year – rather than walk away.

I would like to move gradually.
 
 If I take money from a IRA for a down payment on a new home, I have to repay the IRA within 60 days or incur a $50,000. tax hit. I think that’s too risky. 
 I spoke to a lender who recommended the following: I believe the best option for P would be obtaining a new mortgage, using her retirement funds for the down payment, & adding a recast option to her mortgage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I’m from Sarawak, and I would like to respectfully seek guidance regarding a family heirloom . It is an old Iban Kain Kumbu textile that has been passed down through approximately 4–5 generations in my family.... l am not sure but would like to ask an expert about this!!
 Family lineage timeline:
 • My late great-great grandmother • Passed down to my late great grandmother • Then to my grandmother • Then to my mother • Now in my possession 
 According to my mother’s oral history, this textile was worn by an ancestor named Niang Inik Kantan. The longhouse origin is unfortunately unknown as most elders in our family have passed away sadly no information was to further explaining more about this Kain Kumbu
 The piece appears:
 • Handwoven • Naturally dyed (earth tones, deep browns, muted red/blue) • Smaller in size compared to modern 1970s–1990s Kain Kumbu • In good structural condition • Has a natural woody scent consistent with aged textile storage 
 I am genuinely seeking:
 1. Advice on authentication. 2. How to verify age (pre-1900? 1800s?). 3. Whether museum textile experts in Sarawak or Malaysia would be appropriate to consult. 4. General historical context of early Kain Kumbu weaving. 
 I deeply respect its cultural and spiritual value, and I want to approach this carefully and correctly. Because this is from our family heirloom and been on generations...
 Any guidance from historians, textile experts, collectors, or museum professionals would be sincerely appreciated.
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know the topic of including international stocks has come up a few times this week, but I finally made the change. A few years ago I read The Simple Path to Wealth and started following it's principles, not perfectly, but as well as I could in my situation with a young family. I have been watching VXUS over the past year due to seeing an interview with J.L. where he mentioned that he would tell his daughter to watch out for international stocks starting to outperform U.S. stocks due to changes in the global economy. When I saw his blog post this month, I decided to include international stocks as well and I intend to be invested in them long term. 
 I saw another post here that recommended moving all stocks to VT for it's simplicity and just let it ride. However, isn't cost also a major factor? I wanted to keep an eye on costs and implement this in the most cost effective way possible. What I did is take a portion from VTI and move it to VXUS, which will give me a better expense ratio and have very similar performance as just holding VT. VT has an expense ratio of .06%, VXUS is .05%, and VTI is .03%. So, for example, if I have a total of $10,000 invested with approximately $6,000 in VTI and $4,000 (about 60% U.S. and 40% international) I'm only paying .03% for the bulk of my stock portfolio and .05% for the international component instead of .06% to hold everything in one fund. It's easy for me to rebalance to keep about the same ratios as VT as well because I add to the fund throughout the year and can add a little more to VTI or more to VXUS to keep in line with VT. What are some of the arguments against this approach? Is it just for simplicity and not tinkering with your investments?

Donald Trump has told Netflix to remove the Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice from its board or “face the consequences”, while the streaming platform is locked in an extraordinary corporate battle to take control of Warner Bros Discovery (WBD).
In comments posted on his Truth Social platform, the US president described Rice – who served as national security adviser to Barack Obama and UN ambassador and White House adviser under Joe Biden – as a “political hack” and accused her of having “no talent or skills”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought a car almost 2 months ago from a CDJR dealer in MI
 Paid deposit, signed, took truck home. When time came to pay, we hadn’t received any information on the bank yet. We called the dealer and they had us come back in since they worked a better deal out with the same bank- cool whatever better deal
 Now apparently our payment is due tomorrow, but nothing is finalized at the bank STILL.
 Our temp tag expires tomorrow as well. Not too sure what to do or go around this.

I’m not sure that I want to transfer to my current employer because I read that they do not match at all. I’m not sure what is recommended in this situation but I am asking for guidance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last summer my father made a poor choice when he needed a new roof - he went through Erie Roofing, financed through Goodleap, and paid probably twice as much as he should have. He passed away unexpectedly a few weeks ago and we don’t know what to do about the loan. He was the only name on the loan, we have no estate because he didn’t have many assets or money. Nearly all of his bank accounts had me listed in trust and the house is in his and my mother’s name (she is still with us.) my mother is on Social Security and it may not be enough for her to live off of and keep the home, although we are going to try, but the loan will make it nearly impossible. I hate the idea of not paying a debt, but is there any option that allows us to have the loan forgiven due to his death?
 Also - the salesman for Erie specifically told my parents that if he were to die the loan would not have to be repaid, I feel like that was a predatory move on his part and not fully accurate.

Fewer than one in 10 boys aged 14 to 16 in the UK read daily, according to research, which found reading for pleasure was being crowded out of teenage lives by schoolwork, screens and sports.
While reading declines for both boys and girls in early adolescence, there are “signs of recovery” among girls in later teenage years, but boys’ engagement remains persistently low, according to the National Literacy Trust (NLT).

A Guardian analysis of government records has found that the vast majority – 77% – of people who entered deportation proceedings for the first time in 2025 had no criminal conviction, exposing a stark gap between the Trump administration’s rhetoric and reality.
Within days of Donald Trump’s inauguration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) trotted out a phrase that his surrogates would come to use over and over again: “the worst of the worst.”
Fewer than half of the people in the data (40%) had any criminal charge against them, and only 23% had a conviction.
Of those who did have a criminal conviction, nearly half were for non-violent traffic and immigration offenses.
Traffic offenses alone made up nearly 30% of the convictions, the largest category by far.
Some 9% of criminal convictions were for assault, while only 1% were for sexual assault and just 0.5% were for homicide.

Scotland Yard is using AI tools supplied by the US tech company Palantir to monitor staff behaviour in an attempt to root out failing officers, the Guardian has learned.
The Metropolitan police has previously declined to confirm or deny whether it used technology supplied by the company, which also works for the Israeli military and Donald Trump’s ICE operation. It has now confirmed that it is using Palantir’s AI to analyse internal data about sickness levels, absences from duty and overtime patterns in an effort to identify potential shortcomings in professional standards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently bought an off plan studio apartment in Dubai. specifically Dubailand Residence Complex. There are goijg to be major changes and upgrades to the area by 2030. Metros being built, community filling up, 3 malls, a city dedicated to students right above it, new etihad rail, etc... huge developments. price was 548k aed which is 149k usd give or take. now, the studio is 319 sqft and its projected to get done in q3 2028. Current rent there is 45k aed a year (12250 usd/year). 
 The eay its going with inflation and general uptrend of studio rent prices/the upgrades to the area I mentioned earlier everyone is predicting rent to be 55k aed a year (roughly 15k usd) so the roi seems good. 
 payment plan is 20% upfront and 1500 usd a month until completion which will be 50% of the property then after that ill have 20% more saved up meaning ill have to get mortgage for the other 30% (probably going to end hp being a 3 year mortgage on 4% fee). 
 All that said, im 35 and have a small family. This is my introduction to the real estate investment side of things. Was this a smart decision or a bad one?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just found out that Robert Kiyosaki is coming to Malaysia on Feb 27 and I’m not sure if I should attend.
 I used to be into personal finance and investing (crypto and stocks), but I paused everything for 3 years while I was in Australia. I didn’t follow financial news much during that time. Now I’m back working and trying to reconnect, but I feel rusty.
 The ticket is about USD150. For those who’ve attended his talks before, is it worth it? Is it practical or mostly motivation? And does he usually repeat the same ideas from his books, or does he share new insights?
 Thanks 🙏

Iran is refusing to export its 300kg stockpile of highly enriched uranium, but is willing to dilute the purity of the stockpile it holds under the supervision of UN nuclear inspectorate the IAEA, Iranian sources have said.
The proposal will be at the heart of the offer Iran is due to make to the US in the next few days, as the US president, Donald Trump, weighs whether to use his vast naval buildup in the Middle East to attack the country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have 4 credit cards. I use them all. One is my main card which I typically put 3-5k on every month and then pay it off in full on time every month.
 The others I use for subscriptions and odd purchases here and there, probably a total of about $600 across those cards.
 My total utilization never passes 10%. I applied for a new card because my main one is pretty barebones and doesnt offer many rewards. I found one that has decent rewards for travel and dining, so I applied.
 Credit score: 798
 Total unused credit: 72k
 Current balance across all cards: $3200
 Gross Annual income (combined with wife): 312k
 I got approved and they extended me a $5.1k credit line. This is far lower than my current card. Im just confused about why it would be so low.
 I spoke with a coworker and he said its probably because credit companies want me to carry a balance and they dont want someone who pays it off in full every month. Is this the case?

 Went there and yup, they weren't kidding about the huge racks and piles of camera gear strewn all around. 
 Ngl, it was quite fun sorting around the racks and seeing what gems I can pick out. 
 I wonder, are ther any other places like this around KL? Thrift stores, garage sales, etc?

Gregory Peters, co-chief investment officer of fixed income at PGIM, has noted that bringing political pressure to bear on the Fed is an “own goal” – a self-inflicted shock that erodes confidence and is unlikely to deliver lower borrowing costs for the US.
This reassessment – marked by quiet “sell America” trades – is beginning to surface.

 Today I logged in to my account just because, and see there is a refinance loan open on my account dated 2/18. I didnt ask to apply for a loan i didn’t say i wanted a loan I clearly stated I just wanted info and in the call it was stablished I needed to work on my credit and other things before I did anything… is this legal or even normal?? Did this person create a loan application without my consent?? Is this what happens when you call to ask about info? 
 I did not call to apply for a loan AT ALL!!! Let alone to refinance my 2021 3.25% rate. I don’t know what to do!

 Net salary (after deduction + parents) - 2000, excluding meal allowance(400)
 Rent - 600 (include utils)
 Food - 800 (including groceries, twice a month)
 Fuel + maintenance - 90
 Saving + Investment - 300
 Internet - 50

 I might need to increase the internet, since the room im renting has no wifi. I have no costly hobbies, thats why i decided to topup on food. Really choosy with the room, as i rather have a literal empty room if its squeaky clean. Rarely cook, mostly eat outside, this budget mostly derived from my current spending as an intern.

Trump’s rhetoric has ratcheted up tensions between the United States and Denmark, while putting the global spotlight on the Arctic as he insists mineral-rich Greenland is vital for US and Nato security against Russia and China.
He said the boat would treat many “sick” people in Greenland, without providing any details on...]]></summary>

 im 22F and i left that house and trying to find a place currently w the savings i have currently.
 i have a few questions if anyone can give me advice
  
legally can my parents and the police do anything to drag me back? going back to abusive parents is the last thing i want to do. id rather die on my own term then their hands
 i am currently doing acca but im planning to drop out because my mental health cant take this anymore. i have a degree in accounting in one of the top unis in the world but little to no job exprince. since im going to be finding a place and living on my own, i will need a job (currently living in airbnbs and crashing at friends houses) is me dropping out of acca to prioritise getting a job a good decision rn? (keep in mind if i dont do this, ill be force to live w abusive parents)
 is it possible for me to get a fresh grad accounting job in less than a month with just my degree and that supports me (rental and food, i do not own a car or any have any loans)
 lastly, as of rn idk what to do, should i go police and report that my dad tried to kill me by strangling me? im scared if i do, theyll just send me back to my parents. do i stay quiet and try to find a fresh grad job asap and cut contact w them completely?
  
any advice would be appreciated

Australia will “examine all options” after the US president Donald Trump announced a temporary 15% tariff would apply to US imports from all countries.
The US president’s move came less than 24 hours after the US supreme court overturned his original 10% import tariff. Shortly after the ruling, Trump announced he was reinstating the 10% duties using a different law before raising it again to 15%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've spent a few hours trying to wrap my head around why people online (see here) are often adamant that a traditional 401(k) and Roth IRA is the way to go - especially with how high the praise is for the latter - yet I don't often see people talking about doing both a Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA. If the Roth IRA is so great, why wouldn't you want to also do a Roth 401(k)? It seems like they adhere to the same taxation rules, so is there something substantially different about Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA accounts that make them fundamentally different animals that I'm just not aware of? Maybe it's simply for diversification? The only real difference I've heard is that Roth IRAs typically allow for more aggressive investment options and the ability to withdraw contributions easier, but that's about it.
 My job allows me to contribute to a traditional and/or Roth 401(k) with a match up to 4% - my understanding is if I were to switch to a Roth percentage, their match would still go to a traditional, pre-tax account instead - and I'm currently maxing it out on the traditional side while maxing a separate Roth IRA. I'm not uncomfortable with that arrangement, but it still irks me not understanding what makes a Roth 401(k) "bad" but a Roth IRA "good" in the eyes of a lot of people (I know it's largely subjective and relative to individuals' goals, but you know what I mean), when they're like... the same thing as far as I can tell.
 Thanks in advance for any information.

 I just turned to 40yo this year. Currently i do part time grab + part time stock trader with income around 3k-5k per month. Below is my current assets, liabilities and monthly spending budget
 Assets:
 ASB - 300k
 EPF - 200k
 Saving - 10k
 Liability:
 House loan - 270k
 Spending:
 Monthly loan payment - 1.5k
 Water and eletric - 300
 Family internet - 300 (include home and internet mobile data)
 Transport - 500
 Groceries - 600
 Balance - 50% to my wife, 50% saving.
 Tbh, i just tired on doing this part time jobs. So i was thinking of looking for jobs. I have degree in accounting. I used to work as an executive of one of sme company till i got vss during covid end of 2019. So for these years, i worked multiple jobs like grab for time being at that time. On year 2021, i drawn into trading stock and investment and become stock trader till today. Unfortunately, i just felt tired at some point, especially when you didn't get to meet your monthly end commitments.
 So i was thinking of looking for jobs, but from what i read and watch, employment is really bad, even for newly fresh graduate. And even i don't think i will get iv after applying jobs based on my age and status. 
 My apology if my post here is a bit "mess up", i dunno the correct word. Anyway, please help me.

My normal take home monthly is about $4200. I know this is well above the recommended 1/3rd of net to be put towards rent. However, I have absolutely no debt whatsoever. I've spent the last 4 years aggressively paying off all of my student loans while living at home and also own my car. I'm pretty confident I can make it on $2600 a month and will still be able to save some money. I mostly just want a nice place to live. Has anyone done something like this successfully? Or is this a terrible idea?

 She is in her late 60’s, working overtime just to survive, going through a divorce with my dad and has a new worrying intake of alcohol.
 Shes started on dating apps and lost $6000 by sending it to her “boyfriend” overseas. I didnt know until it happened, uploaded his picture to google and found the guy her scammer was posing as. This was around 6 months ago, that $6000 was basically her whole savings. I put parental controls on her phone which she was okay with and it worked for a while but she decided she wanted to try again.
 She showed me a check her new “boyfriend” sent to her house, for $900,000 in his name, which was obviously fake. She didnt know it was fake but was worried so she showed it to me. I used the same method and found who this scammer was posing as.
 Do you have any tips on protecting her finances?
 *Edit*
 She realizes her mistakes and has been asking me for help. I dont want to take complete control of her finances, I just want to help her not loose large sums of money.

Parts of the Maga right may be souring on Israel – but a hardline form of Christian Zionism seems to remain unofficial Trump administration policy, if a heated debate between Tucker Carlson and Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, is any indication.
On Friday, Carlson released a confrontational video interview with Huckabee, conducted at Ben Gurion airport in Israel, that vividly illustrated a gaping divide between two factions of the Republican party. On one side is a Christian nationalist stream of the Maga movement, which views the United States’s close relationship with Israel with increasing suspicion. On the other is an older Christian conservative establishment that views that alliance as a totem of US foreign policy – and in some cases believes that Israeli Jews possess a divine right to a large swathe of the Middle East, US public opinion be damned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't get an expensive master's degree unless you truly need it for career advancement (i.e., you have a very concrete and realistic plan of how you will pay for it). 
 I am a teacher at a private boarding school in Massachusetts. A lot of my colleagues found themselves in the workforce for a few years, usually as teachers, then decided that their life felt stagnant and got a master's degree from places like Columbia or whatever. They figured it was a logical next move as a typical "striver" who wants to achieve the next milestone in life, assuming it would lead to new opportunities. Underrated fact: even at places like Harvard, many of these master's degrees are not particularly selective and will enroll almost any baseline smart/competent person - they're a cash cow for the university primarily used to fund their PhD programs! 
 Anyways, these people end up in serious debt and forego earnings while getting the degrees, sometimes in excess of $100,000. And what did they do with their degree? They went back to teaching - basically the exact same job they already had with the same earning potential. 
 I'm curious if this is a pattern in other lines of work - do any of your coworkers also randomly get masters degree at enormous expense that they don't put to good use? In my opinion you should only go to graduate school for a profession that truly requires the credential (JD, MD, etc), or if you get it funded (via a PhD program or through your employer).

Iran’s foreign minister has said he expects to have a draft counterproposal ready within days after nuclear talks with the US this week, while Donald Trump said he was considering limited military strikes.
The US president has ordered a massive buildup of naval forces in the Middle East, including repositioning aircraft carriers and other warships, leading to fears of an imminent war. But it is not clear if the military movements are intended as an intimidation tactic to put pressure on Iran to make concessions on its nuclear programme.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, 26M looking for some advice on whether my current investment approach makes sense for my age and goals.
 I have about RM2.8k per month to invest, and this is my current monthly allocation:
  
ASB: RM1,000/month
 ETFs: RM800/month (I’ve only recently started getting into ETFs)
 Crypto: RM1,000/month (currently higher to take advantage of the bear market)
  
Current portfolio breakdown:
  
ASB: RM120k
 Crypto: RM15k (Only BTC & ETH)
 Liquid: RM15k
  
My goal is long-term wealth growth, and I’m comfortable with some level of risk since I’m still young.
 I’d really appreciate opinions on:
  
Whether this overall strategy looks reasonable for a 26 year old
 If I should be more conservative or more aggressive
 Thoughts on the split between ASB, ETFs, and crypto, especially as I’m just starting with ETFs. Should I put more into ETF to build it up ASAP and slow down on ASB?
  
Thanks in advance for any feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My mother was given US savings bonds from the woman she cared for as a gift, a substantial amount. These were purchased decades ago, back in the 60s-80s. My mom never did anything with them, and the lady ended up passing away about 10 years ago. We recently found them when she was going through some attic stuff. 
 Her husband passed away a decade before she did, and she had no children. Should we just throw them away?
 EDIT: These bonds are not in my mom's name, the lady who passed away just handed them to my mom over the years as gifts.

Conditions in the north-eastern Syrian camp where 34 Australians have been forcibly returned are deteriorating dramatically, with reports of near-nightly raids, and increasingly violent beatings, amid worsening uncertainty over their futures.
The 11 women and 23 Australian children forced back to Roj camp on Monday returned to find their tents – formerly huddled collectively in a row known as Australia Street – demolished and their possessions seized.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在大马赚钱不容易，她好不容易月入五位数，却换来满身压力。 近日，大马一名女子在 Facebook《XUAN》发文表示，她在大公司打拼多年，从月薪 RM2,800 一路做到月入超过 RM20,000，她本以为事业稳定后，感情也会越来越好，没想到两人的距离却越来越远。 她说，从小家庭背景不好，不想再经历过口袋里只剩 RM30，却还要等三个星期才发薪水的日子。那种不安感，让她对「没钱」特别害怕。为了不再回到过去，她几乎一年无休地工作，用时间和健康换收入。别人看到的是光鲜亮丽，但只有她知道，那是无数个熬夜换来的成绩。 男友是她的第二段感情。刚毕业时，两人都在努力工作。她选择进入大公司实习，一步一步慢慢往上爬。男友却选择做传销行业，相信自己会成为那个幸运儿，赚到大钱。 四年过去，她的收入稳定成长，从四位数变成五位数。男友的收入却一直不稳定。好的时候 RM2,000 至 RM3,000，不好的时候甚至只有 RM100。虽然她不喜欢传销行业，但因为男友热爱，她一直支持。有时候她会帮忙买 RM1,000+ 的产品，也介绍亲戚朋友加入。但是如果有人拒绝，男友就指责她不够用心，说这个行业需要人脉，她必须介绍更多人，他才有收入。 最近他的收入真的不稳定，开始依赖她生活。虽然我们没住在一起，但他的租金是女子一个人承担。这个月男友搬来同住，本以为在一起会更加幸福，却发现生活开销暴涨。两人外出吃一餐就要花 RM100 至 RM200，再加上娱乐、礼物、衣服，甚至 iPhone，多数由她买单。每个月在男友身上的花费至少 RM3000 以上。 男友却说自己负责开车接送，油费很贵。到了月尾，他又向她哭穷，让她还油钱，她也真的给了。 更让她难过的是，男友几乎不做家务。她每天工作到很晚，回家还要收拾残局。 她开始怀疑，这段感情到底是爱，还是负担？她给他吃穿用度，还被男友 PUA 说她 「回家休息不赚钱就是错！」 贴文一出，引起不少网民热议。有人心疼她的付出，也有人劝她认真思考，这段感情是否真的值得继续。 ▼ 分！ ▼ 把钱花在自己身上更好 感情本来就是两个人一起努力，如果只剩一个人在撑，这样还能走下去吗？

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, need some advice.. parents are getting to that age when they want to settle their inheritance issue. Our thought is, rather than splitting up assets and giving this sibling this or that to individually manage, it would be better financially to put everything in a trust or a company and have all sibling manage/share it equally. The basic thinking is that we can do more when we pool our assets all together. From what I’ve read online there are some pros to doing this, protection of assets in case of bankruptcy, and more structured financial planning for future generations..
 I’ve briefly talked to some people (relatives who are in a related field) and so far the initial reaction I get is not to do it because it usually causes rifts in the family but when I dig deeper the cause of that is usually because nobody discusses or agrees to exit terms beforehand.
 So, leaving out family dynamics, just wanted some input on whether it financially makes sense and if so what are technical ways to do this? Very interested to hear from people who’ve actually done something like this. TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a 40 year old 2-storey terrace house I had inherited. It used to be rented out but had been abandoned for about 20 years.
 The property is in a mature township and can fetch about RM400,000 for similar (non-abandoned) units. 
 The house is paid off already, so other than taxes, it doesn’t require any maintenance (other than reimbursing my neighbour for fixes affecting them or cutting the grass) . I’ve received offers around RM250,000 pre-COVID but held on to it hoping for something nearer to RM300,000. I presume the new buyer will spend minimum 100k to refurbish the unit. 
 Just want to rule out keeping the property. I have other homes and have a mortgage on my current own stay. Rental isn’t an option as I don’t want to spend any money fixing the house.
 Questions:
  
How is RPGT calculated? 
  
- S&P was done 40 years 
 - Deceased 20 years ago
 - My name on grant by land office only done last year
  
How much agent fees should I expect? 2% of transacted price? 
 
I have bought subsale before and presume legal expenses bourne by purchaser. Is this correct? Do I incur any legal fees as a seller?
 
Any other tips?

The siege and capture of the Sudanese city of El Fasher by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces group last October bore “the hallmarks of genocide”, a UN-mandated fact-finding mission has said.
In a report detailing the harrowing 18-month occupation of the capital of North Darfur, investigators concluded that the RSF and allied militias deliberately inflicted conditions calculated to bring about the physical destruction of the Zaghawa and Fur ethnic communities.

Peru’s congress has elected José María Balcázar, an octogenarian leftist lawmaker who has defended child marriage, as the country’s interim president ahead of general elections in April.
Balcázar is Peru’s ninth president since 2016. The surprise election, in which Balcázar beat the favourite, María del Carmen Alva, a conservative, came after lawmakers voted to remove José Jerí as president on Tuesday after just four months in office, due to a scandal over secretive meetings with Chinese businessmen.

More than 1,000 Kenyans have been lured to fight for Russia in its war with Ukraine, according to an intelligence report to the Kenyan parliament that highlights the scale of a Russian operation taking African men to the frontline.
The majority leader of Kenya’s national assembly, Kimani Ichung’wah, said “rogue recruitment agencies and individuals in Kenya” were continuing to send Kenyan nationals to fight in the conflict, as he read MPs the summary of an investigation by Kenya’s National Intelligence Service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy CNY / holidays guys!
 29M data analyst here. I’ve been in retail for about 4 years (2 companies). With retail volatility lately, company performance has been quite affected. I recently received a contract offer from a major insurance company in KL. +23% from my current permanent role, with 2 days WFH.
 The downside as you know is that it’s a contract role, so there’s always the uncertainty of renewal/absorption. That said, since it’s a big player in the industry, I’m quite tempted to give it a try.
 Wondering what people think about insurance industry as a whole? I've heard some say with premium prices going up, people might stop paying insurance. 
 The industry is totally new to me so any thoughts is appreciated.

In your experience, do new employers usually consider your base salary or overall total salary when offering a salary package? Ie. Will they base an offer based on RM5,900 or my total salary RM7,300. As I might pivot to a non-sales role, so the transport allowance given might not be as high. Thanks for any input!

 Company A (current company)
  
RM8.5K / month (including allowance)
 4 days WFH, 1 day WFO
 1-3 months bonus
 3-4 % annual increment
 21 days AL
  
Company B (new company)
  
RM11.5K / month (matched by asking salary)
 4 days WFO, 1 day WFH
 1 month bonus (on average)
 ? % annual increment (expecting it to be 2-3%)
 14 days AL
  
I truly value work life balance so my current role is perfect plus the culture and work is fulfilling. I also have a side business that generates roughly RM2-3K / month which may be impacted if I work almost fully in office.
 That said, I acknowledge that company B offers growth in terms of salary progression. What are your thoughts?
 Additional Note:
  
The side business is not very scalable.
 Company B's culture seems like a cinaman company, small startup with all guys who tend to communicate in Mandarin (noticed this while waiting for interview), I don't speak Mandarin... Plus you're expected to stay until 7PM but can come in around 10AM+
 Highly unlikely to get a counteroffer by A as I've already been promoted

Silicon Valley tech billionaires will land in Delhi this week for an AI summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, where leaders of the global south will wrestle for control over the fast-developing technology.
During the week-long AI Impact Summit, attended by thousands of tech executives, government officials and AI safety experts, tech companies valued at trillions of dollars will rub along with leaders of countries such as Kenya and Indonesia, where average wages dip well below $1,000 a month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I am quite financial illiterate (or investment illiterate), and i want to start with investing. Currently i already have quite some money in asb, and like to start in either
  
Gold
 
Stocks (s&p 500 etc)
 
Crypto
 
 Previously i have dipped my legs in trading crypto, and when btc and eth boom last year, i sold everything (due to in need of money) and get quite a profit. But looking at crypto dip so bad rn, makes me a bit scared. Im not looking to put a lot in one of these three, probably around rm200-rm500 monthly.
 Any advice from the professionals?

My job only lasted 3 weeks since they're planning on doing renovation during Ramadan, and I'm not planning to continue as I'm going to be busy after getting my spm results, most likely. But that's besides the point. 
 I'd like to know how to spend my first salary? I'm planning to save up 80% (since I don't really have any necessities to spend on now anyway), but I've also thought of investing– buying gold, or investing on amanah saham. I've heard it's best to start as early as I can, but I'm not sure. I'd love to know what you guys think! :)

When Boniface Mwangi, the prominent Kenyan pro-democracy activist who plans to run for president in 2027, had his phones returned to him by Kenyan authorities after his controversial arrest last July, he immediately noticed a problem: one of the phones was no longer password protected and could be opened without one.

Walid Saadaoui had once worked as a holiday entertainer, organising dance shows and quizzes at a resort in his native Tunisia. After moving to the UK and marrying a British woman, he became a restaurateur and an avid keeper of birds.
All the while, however – as the Guardian’s community affairs correspondent, Chris Osuh, explains – he was hiding a secret: he had pledged allegiance to Islamic State.

Tika Basnet sat facing the glow of her iPhone, a red tika pressed into the center of her forehead. Seven-month-old Briana slept on her lap, her breathing soft and uneven. On the other side of the screen was Mohan Karki, Basnet’s husband, who had yet to hold his daughter.
For Karki, nearly 9,000 miles (14,500km) away, it was already morning. He was in hiding in south Asia, his exact location withheld for his safety, his face breaking into pixels as he watched his daughter sleep.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[新年要扮美美，不少人都会提前做好「变美三宝」，像是做美发、护肤、美甲等。然而，在追求精致外观的背后，可能隐藏着你意想不到的受伤风险。 中国杭州一名 22 岁女子日前做了一款心仪已久的美甲，没想到在隔天骑电动摩托时发生意外，导致指甲连同甲床断裂，甚至引发指骨骨折。 根据《新民晚报》报道，王姓女子为了让手指看起来更修长，还特意贴了延长甲片。不料，她隔天骑车时却不慎摔倒，手掌本能撑地，结果导致左手食指上的延长甲片连同甲床直接断裂流血。她随即前往杭州市临平区中西医结合医院骨科就诊。 经检查发现，王女左手食指出现指骨骨折、甲床破裂，部分甲床外露，必须通过手术修复。院方为她进行指骨骨折闭合复位内固定手术，目前术后恢复情况良好。 接诊的曹立副主任医师指出，如果没有这么细长复杂的美甲，伤势也许不会这么严重。其延长甲片会增加手指的受力面积和杠杆作用，一旦摔倒，很容易产生撬动效应，导致指甲撕脱、甲床损伤，甚至引发骨折。 曹医师也表示，虽然王女情况属于极端个例，但美甲确实会影响手部正常活动，而且指甲造型越复杂，影响就越明显。频繁做美甲或做不当美甲，存在不少健康隐患。 例如，打磨甲面容易让甲层变薄易断；美甲环境不卫生，可能引发指甲真菌感染；频繁去死皮、使用卸甲水或甲油胶等，可能增加过敏性皮肤病或感染性皮肤病等疾病风险；若美甲油质量不佳，还可能诱发呼吸疾病。 此外，曹医师还提醒指甲的生长周期一般为 3 个月，因此两次美甲最好间隔 3 个月以上，且不建议选择过于复杂或者带有突出装饰的款式。 美甲不是不能做，是要适度，别让一时爱美换来受伤和健康代价。

 As we watch the surveillance dystopia unfold across Trump's America, we've spent over a year reporting on the technologies used by ICE, DHS, and other local law enforcement to actively surveil, target and detain citizens and immigrants alike.
 Recently, we uncovered the tool Palantir is making for ICE to find neighborhoods to raid, how local police unmasked millions of surveillance targets because of Flock redaction error and how DHS is lying about killing people in Minneapolis.
 Ask us anything on February 4 at 12 pm ET about the state of surveillance in America. Get your questions in now.
